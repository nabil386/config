Help.PageDescription=This page allows a user to release the change set. When an administrator indicates that change set definition is complete (i.e. all of the business objects for the change set have been identified), the content of the business objects in the change set needs to be frozen and captured. The change set must then be converted to a form suitable for transport and/or external storage and placed in a release area so that it can be used in subsequent activities (transport, apply, revert, etc.). This process is known as change set release.
