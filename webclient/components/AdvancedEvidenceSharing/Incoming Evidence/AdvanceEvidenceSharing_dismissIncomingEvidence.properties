Page.Title=Reject Incoming Evidence Record
Field.StaticText.InformText=If you select this option, the incoming evidence record will be removed from the incoming evidence list. Therefore, the evidence record will not be resolved and might be redisplayed in the incoming evidence list in the future. Also, because the evidence record has not been linked to an evidence record on the target case, the system will not be able to automatically process future shared updates to the evidence record.
Field.StaticText.ConfirmText=Are you sure that you want to reject the incoming evidence record from the list?
ActionControl.Label.Yes=Yes
ActionControl.Label.No=No
