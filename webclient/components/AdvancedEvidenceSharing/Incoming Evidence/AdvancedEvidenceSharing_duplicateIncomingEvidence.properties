Field.StaticText.InformText1=By marking evidence as a duplicate of existing evidence, you are indicating that the selected incoming record is the same piece of information as an evidence record that already exists on this case.
Field.StaticText.InformText2=The system automatically processes shared updates between evidence records that are marked as duplicates of each other. Therefore, on activation of the evidence on this case, any differences in values between these evidence, will result in the evidence being corrected at the source. Also, in future, when an update to one of the evidence records is activated, the system will automatically apply the update to the other evidence record.
Field.StaticText.SelectText=Select the existing evidence record that is a duplicate of the incoming evidence record:
