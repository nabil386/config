Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a service plan type as part of C\u00FAram Service Planning Administration. A service plan is a mechanism by which a Social Enterprise organisation can plan, in an integrated manner, the delivery of services and activities to help a client achieve a specific goal. The administration of service plan types allows an organisation to differentiate between varying programs across the organisation. It also allows organisation to define security parameters for each type of service plan. Service plan security is a type of program security. It is used to govern a user's rights to create, approve, maintain, view, and clone service plan information. To ensure that only suitable types of service plans are available when delivering benefits to a client, a link can be created between a service plan type and the appropriate Integrated Case type. Multiple contract support can be configured at the administration level. If a service plan supports multiple contracts, then changes can be made to a service plan even after it has been accepted. For example, additional plan items can be added to a service plan contract, to provide additional support to the service plan client, even after the client has accepted the contract.
