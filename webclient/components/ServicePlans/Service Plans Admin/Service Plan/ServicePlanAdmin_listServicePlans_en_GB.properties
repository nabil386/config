Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of service plans. A service plan is a mechanism by which a Social Enterprise organisation can plan, in an integrated manner, the delivery of services and activities to help a client achieve a specific goal. The administration of service plan types allows an organisation to differentiate between varying programs across the organisation. A service plan type can be associated with one or more integrated case types and can have one or more goals associated with it.
