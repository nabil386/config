Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to add plan items to a sub-goal. Plan items are the benefits, services and activities that are linked to a plan sub-goal ensuring that this activity is available for delivery with a service plan containing this sub-goal. A plan item can be associated with one or more sub-goals which in turn are associated with one or more service plan goals. An administrator can specify a plan item cost, whether it requires approval and can indicate whether it will integrate with another C\u00FAram object, e.g. a product delivery.
