Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to add existing outcomes to a sub goal. A service plan goal can be further divided into more manageable components called sub-goals. Due to the often-varied nature of service plans across organisations, it is possible to further group service plan sub-goals into plan groups. Plan groups allow a grouping of related sub-goals.
