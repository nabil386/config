Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify a sub-goal as part of a service plan. A service plan goal can be further divided into more manageable components called sub-goals. Due to the often-varied nature of service plans across organizations, it is possible to further group service plan sub-goals into plan groups. Plan groups allow a grouping of related sub-goals. The service plan outcome is recorded when the outcomes for all sub-goals have been entered. This outcome defines whether or not the desired outcome of the service plan has been attained. It is up to the organization to define the requirements for attaining the overall goal.
