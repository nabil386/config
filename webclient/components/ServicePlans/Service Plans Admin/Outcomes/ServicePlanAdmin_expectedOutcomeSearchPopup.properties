Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to search for and select an expected outcome for a service plan. C\u00FAram Service Planning allows organizations to assign outcomes to service plans and service plan elements. The process of assigning outcomes starts with the recording of an expected outcome for each plan item. On completion of that plan item, an actual outcome of 'Attained', 'Not Attained' or 'Canceled' is recorded. Once an actual outcome has been recorded for each plan item, the outcome for the related sub-goal(s) can then be entered. The service plan outcome is recorded when the outcomes for all sub-goals have been entered. This outcome defines whether or not the desired outcome of the service plan has been attained. It is up to the organization to define the requirements for attaining the overall goal.
