Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a planned sub-goal from the Gantt chart view. A service plan goal can be divided into manageable components called sub-goals. Due to the often-varied nature of service plans across organizations, it is possible to further group service plan sub-goals into plan groups. Plan groups allow a grouping of related sub-goals.
