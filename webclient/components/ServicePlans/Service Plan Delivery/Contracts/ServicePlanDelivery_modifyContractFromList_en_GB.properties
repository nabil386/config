Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify a contract. A contract is a formal agreement between the client and the organisation and is seen as a commitment to fully participate in the activities set out in a service plan. It is based on collaboration between the caseworker and the participant. C\u00FAram Service Planning provides the ability to issue a contract to a plan participant or a nominated representative. A nominated representative is a person who can act on behalf of the service plan participant, e.g. the parent or guardian of a child. The service plan contract outlines the goal, sub-goals and plan items within a service plan. It (and all associated contract text) is created in the preferred language of the participant or nominated representative.
