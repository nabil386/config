Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a contract record. A contract represents a formal agreement between the organization and the plan participant, or a nominated representative, to undertake the plan items listed on the service plan. An indicator on the Service Plan entity, multiple- ContractsAllowedInd, is used to determine the type of behavior exhibited by a service plan once a contract has been issued. If this indicator is not set, plan items can't be added or deleted from the plan after the contract has been issued. In addition a contract may only be re-issued under particular circumstances. If this indicator is set, then plan items can be added or deleted from the plan regardless of the contract status and a new contract may be issued at any stage.
