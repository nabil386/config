Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a plan group. A plan group is a grouping of sub-goal(s) and other plan group(s) within a service plan. A plan group is created by a user as a means of logically grouping related sub-goals on a service plan. It is also possible to add a plan group to other plan groups, further extending the flexibility of the service plan structure.
