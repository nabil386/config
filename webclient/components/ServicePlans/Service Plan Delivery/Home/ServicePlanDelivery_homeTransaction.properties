Many organizations create road maps or plans for individuals which detail the benefits and services that an organization can deliver in order to meet their needs. Due to the variety of services provided by different social enterprises, the name given to this type of plan varies greatly across social enterprises, states and countries, e.g., Individual Responsibility Plan, Independence Plan, and Self Sufficiency Plan. The most commonly used term and the term adopted by C\u00FAram is 'Service Plan'.
