Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to use a service plan template record when creating a service plan delivery. Templates are predefined service plans. When creating a service plan from a template the user can select a template on which they wish to base their service plan. A template has a goal associated with it and this goal can have sub-goals associated with it and the sub-goals, in turn, can have plan items associated with them. The goal, sub-goal(s) and plan item(s) that make up the template are translated into a planned goal, planned sub-goal(s) and planned item(s) for the service plan. The created service plan can then be maintained as normal, enabling the user to add or remove any of the predefined sub-goals or plan items if required.
