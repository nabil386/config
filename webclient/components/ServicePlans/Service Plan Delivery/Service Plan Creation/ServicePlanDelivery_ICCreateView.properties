Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a service plan. A service plan is a mechanism by which a Social Enterprise organization can plan, in an integrated manner, the delivery of services and activities to help a client achieve a specific goal. A case worker can either create a new service plan based on the hierarchy of related service plan elements linked together within the Service Plan Administration component, or they can base their service plan on a predefined template.
