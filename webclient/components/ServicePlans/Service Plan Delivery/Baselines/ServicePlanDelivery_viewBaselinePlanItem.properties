Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view base lined planned item details. Plan items are the fundamental building blocks of a Service Plan. They are the benefits, services, and activities that are added to a plan in order to achieve the plan goal. Plan items form the basis of a successful service plan. Each plan item has a desired outcome such as the gaining of full time employment or the completion of a training course. Achieving these desired outcomes is essential to achieving the service plan goal.
