Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify a baseline record. A baseline is a snapshot of a service plan at a certain point in time. When a baseline is created, the service plan goal, plan group(s), sub-goal(s) and plan item(s) present on the plan at that time are recorded.  Baselines can be automatically created by the system at specific points in the delivery of the service plan and may also be manually created by the user.  Baselines are created by the system when a service plan is submitted for approval and on plan approval.
