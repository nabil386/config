Help.PageDescription=The Weekly Service Plan Client Participation List page presents a summary of the total hours each week (Monday to Sunday) spent by the client on all plan items defined for the service plan. This list will include the total number of participation hours recorded for a plan item in a given week, regardless of the plan item sensitivity. Some of the plan items that make up this total time may have a sensitivity greater than that of the current user. Therefore when viewing the participation details for a selected week the total time displayed might not match that displayed in the weekly client participation list page.
