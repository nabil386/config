Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of the organization structures recorded in the system. The organization structure is the highest degree of the organization hierarchy. The organization structure consists of one or more organization units. These units are assigned organization positions. Every user on the system is, in turn, assigned a position. These positions define the organization's reporting structure and are incorporated into work allocation processing.
