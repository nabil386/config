Help.PageDescription=All communications relate to a participant or a case. The place a communication is created from determines whether that communication is related to a participant or a case. Communications created within a case automatically relate to that case. This includes communications created from a case participant's list of communications, a case member's list of communications, or from the communication list for the case itself. Communications created from a participant's list of communications relate to that participant.
