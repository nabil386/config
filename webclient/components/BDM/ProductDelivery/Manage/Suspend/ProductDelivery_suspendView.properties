Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to suspend a case. It may be necessary for the organization to suspend an 'active' product delivery case. For example, the organization may suspend a person's benefits if it suspects that the person is committing benefit fraud. When a case is suspended, existing payments for the case will continue to be paid, however new payments cannot be created until the case is unsuspended.
