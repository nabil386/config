Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to unsuspend a case. It may be necessary for the organisation to suspend an active product delivery case. For example, the organisation may suspend a person's benefits if it suspects that the person is committing benefit fraud. The suspended case can be unsuspended if necessary. If, for example, the organisation later discovers that the person suspected of benefit fraud is innocent. In this case, the suspension can be reversed.
