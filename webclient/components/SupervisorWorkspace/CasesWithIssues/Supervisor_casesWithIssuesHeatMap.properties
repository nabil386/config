Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a heat map of all the cases that were registered during a specified week, and that have issues associated with them. The heat map is color graded by the number of issues associated with each case. Cases with the highest number of associated issues are marked in red, and those with the lowest are in blue. This enables the supervisor to quickly distinguish which cases will require more work at this point.
