Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a working pattern. An organization working pattern is a 14 day working schedule that includes each day of the week and the working hours for each day. C\u00FAram allows you to maintain a record of working patterns for the entire organization. You can either indicate an end date for this working pattern or you can leave the end date open. For open end dates, the system repeats the organization working pattern every 2 weeks. You can also create multiple working patterns for the organization. Note that these patterns cannot have overlapping dates with other organization working patterns.
