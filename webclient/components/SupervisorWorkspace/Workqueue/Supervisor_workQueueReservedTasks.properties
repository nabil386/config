Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view and manage the tasks assigned to the work queue that have been reserved. A graph is displayed that shows open and deferred tasks as a bar chart, broken down by user. The supervisor can use the chart to drill down to lists of open or deferred tasks for each user. From these lists the supervisor can drill down further to view the details of each task.
