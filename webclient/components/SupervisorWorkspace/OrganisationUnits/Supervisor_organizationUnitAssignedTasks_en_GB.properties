Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view tasks that have been assigned to users in an organisation unit and have not yet been reserved by a user. A graph is displayed that shows the assigned tasks as a bar chart that is broken down by user. The supervisor can use the chart to drill down to a list of assigned tasks for each user, and can view the details of each task.
