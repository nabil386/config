Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to merge one or more alternative name evidence from a duplicate record to the master record. A master record is the valid record to be used by case processing. If the organization registers the same individual more than once, any conflicting or additional information recorded can be merged from the duplicate record to the master record as required. For example, if two alternative names exist on the master record and an additional or more up to date alternative name exists on the duplicate record, you can select the additional alternative name and merge it to the master record. This essentially copies the additional alternative name to the master record.
