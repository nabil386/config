Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to merge one or more relationship evidence from a duplicate record to the master record. A master record is the valid record to be used by case processing. If the organization registers the same individual more than once, any conflicting or additional information recorded can be merged from the duplicate record to the master record as required. For example, if two relationship evidence exist on the master record and an additional or more up to date relationship evidence exists on the duplicate record, you can select the additional relationship evidence and merge it to the master record. This essentially copies the additional relationship evidence to the master record.
