Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to merge one or more employment records from a duplicate participant or prospect participant record to the master participant record. A master record is the valid record to be used by case processing. If the organization registers the same individual more than once, any conflicting or additional information recorded can be merged from the duplicate record to the master record as required. This essentially copies the additional record or records to the master participant record.
