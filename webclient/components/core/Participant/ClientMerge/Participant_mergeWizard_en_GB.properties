Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to merge information that has been recorded more than once about the same person or organisation. Information such as addresses and phone numbers that represent participant type data that exists on the duplicate record can be merged using the merge wizard. The details to be merged are applied as the user proceeds through the merge wizard. For example, if an additional address which exists on the duplicate record is chosen to be merged, the address will be copied to the master record and saved even if the user chooses to quit the merge process before completing the merge wizard.
