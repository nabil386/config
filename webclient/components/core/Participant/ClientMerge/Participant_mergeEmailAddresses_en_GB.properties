Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to merge one or more email addresses from a duplicate record to the master record. A master record is the valid record to be used by case processing. If the organisation registers the same individual more than once, any conflicting or additional information recorded can be merged from the duplicate record to the master record as required. For example, if two email addresses exist on the master record and an additional or more up to date email address exists on the duplicate record, you can select the additional email address and merge it to the master record. This essentially copies the additional email address to the master record.
