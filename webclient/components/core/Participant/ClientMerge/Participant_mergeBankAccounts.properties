Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to merge one or more bank accounts from a duplicate record to the master record. A master record is the valid record to be used by case processing. If the organization registers the same individual more than once, any conflicting or additional information recorded can be merged from the duplicate record to the master record as required. For example, if two bank accounts exist on the master record and an additional or more up to date bank account exists on the duplicate record, you can select the additional bank account and merge it to the master record. This essentially copies the additional bank account to the master record.
