Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a duplicate participant record. For various reasons it sometimes happens that the organization records information about the same person or organization more than once.  When the organization becomes aware that they have registered a person or an organization more than once, they need to merge the information recorded so that duplicate or conflicting information isn't used. Merging participant records involves marking one participant as a duplicate, and then manually merging the two records. Extra information can be included on the valid record from the duplicate where appropriate, e.g., an additional phone number or a more up to date address.
