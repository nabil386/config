Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view details of a benefit underpayment. An underpayment occurs when too little has been paid out on the case. If an underpayment is detected during case reassessment, an underpayment case is automatically created linking the under payment case to the product delivery case that gave rise to the underpayment.

Page.Title.Deductions=Deductions
Page.Title.Deductions.Help=Deductions are created on cases and are used to allocate a portion of a benefit toward a liability or a third party.
Page.Title.AppliedUnapplied=Applied and Un-applied Deductions
Page.Title.AppliedUnapplied.Help=An applied deduction is an amount that can be deducted from a benefit payment and applied towards an outstanding liability owed to the organisation. For example, $10 of a person's benefit payment can be applied towards an overpayment that was previously issued to that person. An un-applied deduction is a standalone deduction amount that is not applied toward a specific liability. The deduction amount can be used to make a general refund to the organization. For example, if a person is issued a one-off payment from an emergency fund, the organization can later deduct the amount from the person's benefit to recoup the payment.

Page.Title.ThirdParty=Third Party Deductions
# BEGIN, CR00273471, PS
Page.Title.ThirdParty.Help=A third party deduction is an amount that is deducted from a person's benefit payment in order to pay off charges, costs, or debts owed to another participant. A person may decide to apportion his or her benefits in this way to budget for the household or to clear an existing bill.
