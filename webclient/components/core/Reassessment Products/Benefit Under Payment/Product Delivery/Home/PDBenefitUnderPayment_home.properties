Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view details of a benefit underpayment. An underpayment occurs when too little has been paid out on the case. If an underpayment is detected during case reassessment, an underpayment case is automatically created linking the under payment case to the product delivery case that gave rise to the underpayment. Benefit underpayment processing can also be configured so that underpayment cases will only be created for a case recipient with outstanding liabilities. This is to support the allocation of an underpayment toward an outstanding liability.
