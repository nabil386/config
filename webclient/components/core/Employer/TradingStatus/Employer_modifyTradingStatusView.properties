Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view an employer's trading status record. A trading status is a record of whether an employer is currently trading. An employer's trading status can be 'active', 'ceased trading', or 'liquidated'. Note that only an 'actively trading' employer can be listed as a person's current employer.

Field.Label.TradingStatus=Trading Status
Field.Label.TradingStatus.Help=This field is used to specify the operating status of the registered employer during a set time period. Note that the system does not allow you to choose opposing trading statuses during the same time frame, i.e. you cannot have an actively trading status during a set time when the employer has ceased trading. Note also that if the trading status is 'liquidated', the system sets the employer status to 'closed' and sets the employer end date.
Field.Label.From=From
Field.Label.From.Help=Period of time from which the above-mentioned trading status is valid. 
Field.Label.To=To
Field.Label.To.Help=Period of time to which the above-mentioned trading status is valid. The system automatically sets the "to" date for a trading status when a new trading status is recorded on the system. This "to" date is set for the date before the new trading status "from" date.
