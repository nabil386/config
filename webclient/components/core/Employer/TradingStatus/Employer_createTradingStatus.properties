Field.Label.TradingStatus=Trading Status
Field.Label.TradingStatus.Help=This field is used to specify the operating status of the registered employer during a set time period. Note that the system does not allow you to choose opposing trading statuses during the same time frame, i.e. you cannot have an actively trading status during a set time when the employer has ceased trading. Note also that if the trading status is "liquidated", the system sets the employer status to "closed" and sets the employer end date.
Field.Label.StartDate=From
Field.Label.StartDate.Help=Period of time from which the above-mentioned trading status is valid. An employer can have many trading status records, but the "from/to" dates for these records may not overlap.
Field.Label.EndDate=To
Field.Label.EndDate.Help=Period of time to which the above-mentioned trading status is valid. An employer can have many trading status records, but the "from/to" dates for these records may not overlap. The system automatically sets the "to" date for a trading status when a new trading status is recorded on the system. This "to" date is set for the date before the new trading status "from" date.
