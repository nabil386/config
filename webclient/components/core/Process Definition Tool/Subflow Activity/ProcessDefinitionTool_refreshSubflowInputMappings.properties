PageTitle.StaticText1=Refresh Subflow Input Mappings:\ 

Question.Description=Are you sure you want to refresh the mappings associated with this subflow activity?  The existing mappings as specified on the previous page will be compared to the workflow data object attributes marked as required for enactment on the subflow process definition.  If the target workflow data object no longer exists in the subflow process definition, the entry is deleted from the list of mappings. If a new workflow data object that has been marked as required for enactment has been added to the subflow process definition, a new mapping entry is created and added to the list. Finally, existing mapping entries are validated to ensure that their types are compatible.
