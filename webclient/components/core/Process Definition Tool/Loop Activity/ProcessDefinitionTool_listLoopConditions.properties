Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of loop conditions for a loop activity. One or more loop conditions can be added to a loop. The sum of these conditions define when the loop should stop executing. They are combined together to equal one expression which determines when the loop stops repeating. All activities within the loop are repeated until the expression evaluates to false. Each loop condition can either be function based or data based. Data item conditions are where a chosen operator is applied to either two WDO attribute values or to a WDO attribute value and a constant. Each function condition contains a function of either "not" or "is nothing".

Action.Label.Reorder=Reorder
Action.Label.Reorder.Help=Click the Reorder link on the appropriate row to move the selected loop condition to a new location in the overall loop condition expression.
Action.Label.Delete=Delete
Action.Label.Delete.Help=Click the Delete link on the appropriate row to delete the selected loop condition. This removes the loop condition from the overall loop condition expression.

Container.Label.Condition=Condition
Container.Label.Condition.Help=Value of the condition. All loop conditions have a conditional operator, e.g., AND, which indicates how this loop condition fits in with the other loop conditions. All conditions have a WDO attribute, i.e., the date the condition acts upon. Also, conditions can have parentheses which indicate how the condition fits into the overall condition expression. Additional information is included in this value depending on whether the loop condition is a data item condition or a function condition.
Container.Label.Valid=Valid
Container.Label.Valid.Help=Indicates if the condition is valid. A condition is valid if any specified workflow data object attributes are valid and also if the types of the expressions on either side of the condition are compatible.
