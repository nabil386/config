Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a data item condition for a loop activity. One or more loop conditions can be added to an activity and the sum of these conditions define when the loop should stop executing. Each loop condition can either be function based or data based. Data item conditions are where a chosen operator is applied to either two workflow data object attribute values or to a workflow data object attribute value and a constant. An example of two workflow data object attribute values that might be used as a data item condition expression for a loop might read, "if username of case owner equals username of case supervisor, then set condition to true".
