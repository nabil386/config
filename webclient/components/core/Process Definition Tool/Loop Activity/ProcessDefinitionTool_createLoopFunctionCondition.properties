Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a function condition for a loop activity. One or more loop conditions can be added to an activity and the sum of these conditions define when the loop should stop executing. Each loop condition can either be function based or data based. Function conditions are not used as frequently as data based conditions. Each function condition contains a function of either "not" or "is nothing". For example, a function expression might be set to true if the workflow data object of case ID is not found, i.e., there is no case ID value.
