Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a data item condition for a transition. A transition may optionally define a condition which must be met before the transition will be followed. Transition conditions can be a combination of sub-conditions. These sub-conditions are combined together to equal one expression which the Workflow Engine uses to determine whether or not the transition has been successful and the next activity can begin. Sub-conditions can either be function based or data based. Data item conditions are where a chosen operator is applied to either two workflow data object attribute values or to a workflow data object attribute value and a constant. An example of two workflow data object attribute values that might be used as a condition expression for a transition might read, "if person is over 18, then set condition to true".
