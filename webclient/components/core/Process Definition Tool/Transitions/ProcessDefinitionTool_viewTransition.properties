Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a transition. A transition describes the flow of a workflow process between two activities. There are two important aspects of activity transitions: the transition type and the transition conditions. The transition type determines the flow from one activity to the next activity or activities. Transition conditions are used by transitions to determine the route through a workflow process.
