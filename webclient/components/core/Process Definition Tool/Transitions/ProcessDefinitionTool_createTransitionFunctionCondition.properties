Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a function condition for a transition. A transition may optionally define a condition which must be met before the transition will be followed. Transition conditions can be a combination of sub-conditions. These sub-conditions are combined together to equal one expression which the Workflow Engine uses to determine whether or not the transition has been successful and the next activity can begin. Sub-conditions can either be function based or data based. Function conditions are simple conditions which contain a function of either "not" or "is nothing". For example, a function condition might determine whether or not a case ID exists, by searching for a case ID, and if "not found", determining the condition to be true or false. This might be helpful if the Workflow Engine requires a specific case ID to continue on to the next activity. If this case ID is not found, then the Workflow Engine would not complete such a transition.
