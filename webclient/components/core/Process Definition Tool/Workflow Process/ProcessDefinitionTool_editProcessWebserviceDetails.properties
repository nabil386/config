Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to edit web service details. C\u00FAram workflows can inter-operate with other workflow systems through support for specific aspects of the Oasis group's Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) standard. This is done by providing functionality to expose C\u00FAram workflow processes as web services that can be invoked from BPEL process partner links.
