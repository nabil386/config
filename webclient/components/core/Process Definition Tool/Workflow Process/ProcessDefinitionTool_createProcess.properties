Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a workflow process definition. Workflow process definitions can be used to support the automation of business processes and to route work among individuals and departments. A new instance is created each time a workflow process definition is enacted.

Field.Label.Description.Help=A detailed description of this workflow process definition.
Field.Label.StartProcessSplitType=Start Process Split Type
Field.Label.StartProcessSplitType.Help=The split type of the start process activity. A NONE split type indicates that there is only one transition from this activity to the next activity. For Parallel and Choice split types, there can be multiple transitions. With a Parallel split type, the transitions will run parallel to each other. The Workflow Engine will determine which of these transitions are true, and then execute the activities whose transitions are true at the same time. With a Choice split type, the Workflow Engine will determine the first transition which is true and execute only one activity based on this determination.
Field.Label.EndProcessJoinType=End Process Join Type
Field.Label.EndProcessJoinType.Help=The join type of the end process activity. The type of join used for incoming transitions is either NONE, Parallel (AND), or Choice (XOR). The reason these are the same as the split types is because each outgoing transition must have a corresponding incoming transition (of the same type) that resolves the transition path.
