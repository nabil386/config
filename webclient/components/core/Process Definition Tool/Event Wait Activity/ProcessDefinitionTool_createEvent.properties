Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create an event. For manual and event wait activities, the Workflow Engine waits for an event which signals it to proceed onto the next activity in the workflow. For manual activities, the event can signify that a user has completed the task; for event wait activities, the event can signify that a method has been completed. The event wait information describes the actions that an activity must wait on before continuing execution of the workflow.
