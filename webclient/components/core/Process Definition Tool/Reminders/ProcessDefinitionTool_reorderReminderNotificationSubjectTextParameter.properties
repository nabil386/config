Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to reorder the subject text parameter for a notification body. This is done by inserting a parameter before another parameter. This changes the order of the parameter list, which in turn will change the values of the parameter in the body text. For example, if a parameter is third in the list, and it is moved to second in the list, then anywhere in the subject text that calls for the second parameter will now have the value of the reordered parameter. All parameters after the second parameter will also have new values based on the reordered list.
