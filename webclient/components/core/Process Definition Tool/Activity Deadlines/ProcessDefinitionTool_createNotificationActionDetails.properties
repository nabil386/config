Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a notification action. An action is simply a parameterized hyperlink to a C\u00FAram page that can be used to perform some action. The action is made up of the page ID of the C\u00FAram page and the action text that describes the action. The page ID has a number of link parameters associated with it and the action text can contain replaceable strings.

PageTitle.StaticText1=New Notification Action 

Cluster.Title=Action Details
Cluster.Ocurring.Title=Multiple Occurring Action

Field.Label.PageID=Page ID
Field.Label.PageID.Help=Page ID of the C\u00FAram page associated with this action. The page ID has a number of link parameters which are name and value pairs, where the name is the name of a parameter to be passed to the C\u00FAram page and value is the WDO attribute that should be mapped to this parameter. 
Field.Label.ActionText=Action Text
Field.Label.ActionText.Help=Text to describe the action. The action text can contain replaceable strings. An action text parameter is a mapping to a WDO attribute. Parameter "k" in the list will replace "%k" in the action text string, where k is the order of the parameter in the list. "%k" can be repeated within the string and thus each WDO attribute must only be mapped once. A format for the replaceable strings can optionally be specified by placing another letter after the replaceable string, e.g. %1d, where d will format the value as a date.
Field.Label.OpenInModal=Open In Modal
Field.Label.OpenInModal.Help=Boolean indicating if the link specified for this action will open in a modal window. If set to true, then the link will open in a modal; if set to false (the default) then the infrastructure will decide how to open the link, just like any other link. In that scenario, if the page is part of a tab configuration, then it will open the appropriate tab, if not then the page contents will just replace the home page in the content area of the current tab.
Field.Label.WDOToUse=List Data Object To Use
Field.Label.WDOToUse.Help=When a List WDO is specified for an action, this indicates that this is a multiple occurring action. This means that when the associated activity is executed, one action will be created for each item which is present in this List WDO.
