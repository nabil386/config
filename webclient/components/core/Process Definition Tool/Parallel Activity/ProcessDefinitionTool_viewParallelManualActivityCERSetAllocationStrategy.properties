Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view the allocation strategy details of type CER for a parallel manual activity. A parallel activity acts as a wrapper around existing activities. The effect of using one of these new activities at runtime is that multiple instances of the wrapped activity are executed in parallel. To date, the only supported types of wrapped activity are Manual and Decision activities. Therefore, executing a parallel activity currently equates to the creation and allocation of multiple tasks in parallel.
