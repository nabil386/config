Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a parallel manual activity as part of a function allocation strategy. A parallel activity acts as a wrapper around existing activities. The effect of using one of these new activities at runtime is that multiple instances of the wrapped activity are executed in parallel. To date, the only supported types of wrapped activity are Manual and Decision activities. Therefore, executing a parallel activity currently equates to the creation and allocation of multiple tasks in parallel.

Link.RefreshInputMappings.Help=This page allows you to refresh the input mappings for the allocation function. The existing mappings as specified on the previous page will be compared against the current definition of the business process object method specified as the allocation strategy. Any mappings that exist for formal parameter fields that no longer exist in the business process object method will be deleted. Initial mappings for any new formal parameter fields defined in the current business process object method will be added. Finally, all the mappings will be validated to ensure that the types are compatible.
