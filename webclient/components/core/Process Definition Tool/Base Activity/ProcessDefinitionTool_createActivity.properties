Field.Label.ActivityName=Activity Name
Field.Label.ActivityName.Help=The unique name of the activity.
Field.Label.ActivityType=Type
Field.Label.ActivityType.Help=The type of the activity. There are nine activity types: start, end, automatic, manual, event wait, route, subflow, loop, and decision. 
Field.Label.SplitType=Split Type
Field.Label.SplitType.Help=The type of split used for outgoing transitions is either NONE, Parallel (AND), or Choice (XOR). A NONE split type indicates that there is only one transition from this activity to the next activity. For Parallel and Choice split types, there can be multiple transitions. With a Parallel split type, the transitions will run parallel to each other. The Workflow Engine will determine which of these transitions are true, and then execute the activities whose transitions are true at the same time. With a Choice split type, the Workflow Engine will determine the first transition which is true and execute only one activity based on this determination.
Field.Label.JoinType=Join Type
Field.Label.JoinType.Help=The type of join used for incoming transitions is either NONE, Parallel (AND), or Choice (XOR). The reason these are the same as the split types is because each outgoing transition must have a corresponding incoming transition (of the same type) that resolves the transition path. 
Field.Label.Category=Category
Field.Label.Category.Help=The category of the activity.
Field.Label.ParallelActivityType=Parallel Activity Type
Field.Label.ParallelActivityType.Help=If the activity type is parallel, this field describes the type of activity that will be wrapped by the parallel activity i.e. Manual or Decision.
