Link.RefreshInputMappings.Help=This page allows you to refresh the input mappings for the allocation function. The existing mappings as specified on the previous page will be compared against the current definition of the business process object method specified as the allocation strategy. Any mappings that exist for formal parameter fields that no longer exist in the business process object method will be deleted. Initial mappings for any new formal parameter fields defined in the current business process object method will be added. Finally, all the mappings will be validated to ensure that the types are compatible.
