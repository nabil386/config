Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to reserve a work queue task. 

PageTitle.StaticText1=Get Next Work Queue Task

ActionControl.Label.Yes=Yes
ActionControl.Label.Yes.Help=This function reserves the next task on the selected work queue. The task to reserve is determined using the task priority and the date on which the task was assigned to the work queue. This function reserves the highest priority task which is assigned to the work queue for the longest period. An environment variable is used to control whether task priority is used in determining which task to reserve. If this variable is set to exclude task priority, then the task assigned to the work queue for the longest period is reserved regardless of priority. If a task is reserved, then the Task Home page is opened displaying the details of the reserved task.
ActionControl.Label.No=No
ActionControl.Label.No.Help=Closes the page and returns to the Work Queues list page

Field.StaticText.ReserveWorkQueueTask=Are you sure you want to get the next task on this work queue?
