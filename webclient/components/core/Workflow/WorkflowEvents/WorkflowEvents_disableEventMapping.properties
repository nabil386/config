Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to disable a workflow event mapping. Each event type can have one or more workflow process enactments associated with it. These are enactment mappings to workflow processes. When the event of this class and type is raised, the Workflow Engine will enact a process instance for each of the workflow processes associated with the event type, provided that the workflow process enactments are enabled and the necessary enactment data has been mapped to event data.
