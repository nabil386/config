Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to search for a workflow process. A workflow is a sequence of activities that makes up a business process. Activities may be automatic, performed using machine resources, or manual, requiring the intervention of a human agent. Transition rules encoded in the workflow process definition determine how work is routed between activities. Agents use the Inbox to view and action the tasks assigned to them in the workflow. When tasks are actioned, the software application raises events to inform the Workflow Management System that the task has been completed, and that the workflow can resume.
