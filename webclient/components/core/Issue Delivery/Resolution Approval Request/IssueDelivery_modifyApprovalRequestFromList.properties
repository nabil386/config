Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify an approval request. Each time a resolution is submitted by a caseworker for approval, the resolution approval request is automatically recorded on the list of resolution approval requests. The list displays the name of the user who requested the resolution approval and the date the request was made. If the system determines that the resolution is to be automatically approved, an approval decision date is set to the current date and the resolution status is displayed.
