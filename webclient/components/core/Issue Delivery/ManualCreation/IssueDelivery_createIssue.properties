Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create an issue on a case. Issue creation establishes the evidence type that the issue relates to, for example "employment evidence" and the issue type that is related to the evidence, for example, "earned income". During issue creation, the user indicates the evidence that gave rise to the issue. The system automatically stores a snapshot of this evidence at the time the issue was created and links it and the current evidence to the issue.
