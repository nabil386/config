Page.Title=Evidence Dashboard
Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a dashboard which displays the evidence for this case. Evidence is the data collected by an organization to facilitate the delivery of services to the organization's customers. Evidence is normally used by the rules to determine an outcome (payment, bill, etc.) or for reporting purposes. For example, in order to assess a person's eligibility for sickness benefit, you must record the date on which the person became sick and could no longer work. C\u00FAram provides an evidence list page for every case.\n If a dashboard evidence group has been configured on this case type then it can be selected via the Display Evidence Group combo box. Selecting a dashboard group will filter the evidence dashboard so that it only displays the evidence types associated with that group. Evidence types that have an asterisk are required as part of that evidence group. Evidence types which are flagged as required are used to prompt the user that the evidence type should be entered as part of the task this evidence group relates to. No validation will be thrown if a required evidence type is not recorded for an evidence group.
