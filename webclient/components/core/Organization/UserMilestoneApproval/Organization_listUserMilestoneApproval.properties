Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of the organization unit milestone waiver approval checks recorded in the system. A milestone approval check is a review of a milestone submitted for approval by a caseworker.  Depending on the experience of the caseworker, you may want the system to automatically approve the milestone waiver. To achieve this, C\u00FAram allows you to set milestone waiver approval checks for organization units. These milestone waiver approval checks allow you to define the percentage of milestone waiver in an organization unit that should be reviewed by the supervisor.
