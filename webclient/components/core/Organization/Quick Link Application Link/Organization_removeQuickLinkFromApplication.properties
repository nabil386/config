Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to remove a quick link added to an application. Quick links are created for the organization and can be associated with an application code. When the user logs into the system, any quick links that have been associated with their application code will be displayed on their home page. For example, an administrator may decide to add the following quick links to the application workspace: links to create a case, find a person, register a participant, change my password and search for a case. The case worker will always have access to each quick link regardless of how their home page is configured.
