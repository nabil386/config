Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a rate table. Rates are product rule values, typically defined by legislation, that can vary over time. An example of a rate would be the Gross Income and Net Income limits based on the number of people in a household. C\u00FAram allows you to store these rates on a rate table. On a rate table, you can manipulate the rows and columns, as well as the values of the individual rates. Since rate tables can be created and maintained independently, this allows for a more flexible approach to product rules.

Field.Label.TableType=Rate Table Type
Field.Label.TableType.Help=Rate table type assigned to the rate table. Your organisation determines these rate table types, for example, there may be a rate table type relating to specific product values. Rate table types are recorded on the system by an application developer. A system administrator must add a new rate table type to the RateTableType code table in order for you to be able to select that rate table type. For information on code tables, see "Code Tables" in the C\u00FAram Administration Guide. Note that you cannot create duplicate rate tables with the same effective date and rate table type.
