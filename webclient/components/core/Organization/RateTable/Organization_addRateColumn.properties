Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to add a column to a rate table. Rate tables contain product rule values, typically defined by legislation, that can vary over time. The columns, rows, and cells of a rate table allow you to store multiple series of individual rates. Additional columns, sub-columns, rows, sub-rows, and cells can be added at any time, which allows for a very flexible approach to product rule values.
