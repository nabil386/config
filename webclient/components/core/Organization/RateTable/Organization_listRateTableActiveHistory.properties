Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a historical list of all active rate tables in the system.  Rates are product rule values, typically defined by legislation, that can vary over time. An example of a rate would be the Gross Income and Net Income limits based on the number of people in a household. C\u00FAram allows you to store these rates on a rate table. On a rate table, you can manipulate the rows and columns, as well as the values of the individual rates. Since rate tables can be created and maintained independently, this allows for a more flexible approach to product rules.
