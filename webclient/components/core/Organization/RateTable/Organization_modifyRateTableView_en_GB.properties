Rate table types are recorded on the system by an application developer. A system administrator must add a new rate table type to the RateTableType code table in order for you to be able to select that rate table type. For information on code tables, see "Code Tables" in the C\u00FAram Administration Guide. Note that you cannot create duplicate rate tables with the same effective date and rate table type.
