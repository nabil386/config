Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to add a sub-row to a rate table. Rate tables contain product rule values, typically defined by legislation, that can vary over time. The rows, columns, and cells of a rate table allow you to store multiple series of individual rates. Additional sub-rows, rows, columns, sub-columns, and cells can be added at any time, which allows for a very flexible approach to product rule values.
