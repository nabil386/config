Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to select an organisation unit from a list of the organisation units recorded in the system. An organisation structure contains one or more organisation units. In order to implement the organisation hierarchy on the system, the active organisation structure must contain a root unit. This is the first organisation unit added to the organisation structure. Subsequent units can be added and these units can be arranged into any number of parent-child relationships.
