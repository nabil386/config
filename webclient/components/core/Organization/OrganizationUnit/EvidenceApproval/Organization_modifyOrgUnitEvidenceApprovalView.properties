Field.Label.Percentage.Help=The system notifies the case supervisor of evidence changes according to this percentage. For example, if this percentage is 50 percent, the system notifies the case supervisor of only half of the changes made to evidence by users in the organization unit. The default percentage is 0; however, a zero value indicates that notification is made for any changes to evidence by users in the organization unit. Note that this percentage applies to cases governed by a selected product or by all products (see "Product" field below).
Field.Label.Product=Product
Field.Label.Product.Help=Name of the product to which the organization unit evidence approval check applies. To select a product, press the Search button provided to open the Products pop-up window. Click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of the products displayed. If you select a product, then the case supervisor is only notified of changes made to the evidence of cases governed by that product according to the above percentage.
