Field.Label.Percentage.Help=The system notifies the case supervisor of evidence changes according to this percentage. For example, if this percentage is 50 percent, the system notifies the case supervisor of only half of the changes made to evidence by users in the organization unit. The default percentage is 0; however, a zero value indicates that notification is made for any changes to evidence by users in the organization unit. Note that this percentage applies to cases governed by a selected product or by all products (see "Product" field below).
Field.Label.AppliesToAll=Applies to All Products
Field.Label.AppliesToAll.Help=This field indicates whether the organization unit evidence approval check should be applied to all products. If you select all products, then the case supervisor is notified of changes made to the evidence of cases governed by all products according to the above percentage.
