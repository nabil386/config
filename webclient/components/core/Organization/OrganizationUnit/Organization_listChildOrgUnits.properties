Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of the child organization units for an organization unit. An organization structure contains one or more organization units. In order to implement the organization hierarchy on the system, the active organization structure must contain a root unit. This is the first organization unit added to the organization structure. Subsequent units can be added and these units can be arranged into any number of parent-child relationships.
