Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify evidence approval checks. An evidence approval check ensures that a case supervisor is notified when changes are made to evidence. Your organisation may require notification on any changes made to evidence by users within a specific organisation unit.

Field.Label.Percentage.Help=The system notifies the case supervisor of evidence changes according to this percentage. For example, if this percentage is 50 percent, the system notifies the case supervisor of only half of the changes made to evidence by users in the organisation unit. The default percentage is 0; however, a zero value indicates that notification is made for any changes to evidence by users in the organisation unit. Note that this percentage applies to cases governed by a selected product or by all products.

Field.Label.Product.Help=Name of the product to which the organisation unit evidence approval check applies. To select a product, press the Search button provided to open the Products pop-up window. Click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of the products displayed. If you select a product, then the case supervisor is only notified of changes made to the evidence of cases governed by that product according to the above percentage.
