Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to enable a user account. When a user's account is disabled, the user can no longer log into the system. An example of when a user's account may be enabled is when a user's account is set up on the system in advance of joining the agency and the user's account is left disabled until they commence work. Once they commence work, the account is enabled.
