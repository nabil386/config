Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view and manage your user activities using a calendar view. A calendar page is provided for each user of the application. This page allows you to navigate through planned activities and provides the tools necessary to manage daily activities. Activities are events scheduled for a specific time period. There are two activity types: standard activity and recurring activity. A standard activity is a one-off event scheduled for a specific time period, e.g., a meeting between a case worker and a case participant. A recurring activity is an activity that recurs over a period of time, e.g., a weekly status meeting.
