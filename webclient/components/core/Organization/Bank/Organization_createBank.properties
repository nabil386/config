Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a record for a bank that the organization deals with. Banks include both the banks where the organization keeps its money and the banks used by participants, providers, etc.  A bank is an institution that offers financial services.  Although the management of the organization's own bank accounts is done from the Organization Bank Accounts page within C\u00FAram, actual financial transactions between the organization and a participant or provider may require the registration of bank details for the participants' or providers' bank institutions. C\u00FAram allows you to maintain a record of general bank details, specifically contact information, for all banks interacting with the organization.
