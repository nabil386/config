Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view the details of a bank that the organisation deals with. A bank is an institution that offers financial services. Although the management of the organisation's own bank accounts is done from the Organisation Bank Accounts page within C\u00FAram, actual financial transactions between the organisation and a participant or provider may require the registration of bank details for the participant or provider's bank institution. You can manage the bank details for all bank institutions interacting with the organisation. These bank institutions include both the banks where the organisation keeps their money and the banks used by the participants, providers, etc. C\u00FAram allows you to maintain a record of general bank details, specifically contact information, for all banks interacting with the organisation.
