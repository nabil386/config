Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to confirm the deletion of a bank that the organisation deals with. A bank is an institution that offers financial services. Although the management of the organisation's own bank accounts is done from the Organisation Bank Accounts page within C\u00FAram, actual financial transactions between the organisation and a participant or provider may require the registration of bank details for the participant or provider's bank institution.
