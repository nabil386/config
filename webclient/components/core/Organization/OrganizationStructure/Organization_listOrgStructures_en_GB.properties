Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of the organisation structures recorded in the system. The organisation structure is the highest degree of the organisation hierarchy. The organisation structure consists of one or more organisation units. These units are assigned organisation positions. Every user on the system is, in turn, assigned a position. These positions define the organisation's reporting structure and are incorporated into work allocation processing.
