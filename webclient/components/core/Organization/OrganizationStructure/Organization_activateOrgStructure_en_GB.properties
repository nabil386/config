Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to confirm the activation of the organisation structure. The active organisation structure defines the organisation hierarchy and the reporting hierarchy; as such, there can only be one organisation structure with a status of "active". Note that when you activate the organisation structure, you also activate the organisation units, positions, and users within that structure.
