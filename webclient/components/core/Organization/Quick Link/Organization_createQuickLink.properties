Help.PageDescription=This page allows administrator to create a quick link for an organization. Quick links are created for the organization and can be associated with a user's security role. When the user logs into the system, any quick links that have been associated with their role will be displayed on their home page. For example, an administrator may decide to add the following quick links to the case worker security role: links to create a case, find a person, register a participant, change my password and search for a case. The case worker will always have access to each quick link added regardless of how their home page is configured.
