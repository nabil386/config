Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify a quick link added by an administrator for the organisation. Quick links are created for the organisation and can be associated with a user's security role. When the user logs into the system, any quick links that have been associated with their role will be displayed on their home page. For example, an administrator may decide to add the following quick links to the case worker security role: links to create a case, find a person, register a participant, change my password and search for a case. The caseworker will always have access to each quick link regardless of how their home page is configured.
