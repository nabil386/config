Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to delete a quick link created by an administrator. Quick links are created for the organisation and can be associated with an  application code. When the user logs into the system, any quick links that have been associated with their role will be displayed on their home page. For example, an administrator may decide to add the following quick links to the case worker security role: links to create a case, find a person, register a participant, change my password and search for a case. The caseworker will always have access to each quick link added regardless of how their home page is configured.
