Field.Label.DateFrom=Date From
Field.Label.DateFrom.Help=Start date of the payment exclusion period. A period can be one day or several days in a row. Note that the Date From cannot be in the past, i.e., you cannot set up a payment exclusion period starting on a date before the current date on the system. Note that the system will not allow the dates of cash payment exclusion periods to overlap one another.
Field.Label.DateTo=Date To
Field.Label.DateTo.Help=Last date of the payment exclusion period. Note that the system will not allow the dates of cash payment exclusion periods to overlap one another.
Field.Label.Reason=Reason
Field.Label.Reason.Help=Reason for the payment exclusion date, e.g., public holiday. Your system administrator can add a new reason for a payment exclusion date to this drop-down list via the Code Tables page (see "Code Tables" in the C\u00FAram Administration Guide). 
Field.Label.Prepayment=Prepayment Required
Field.Label.Prepayment.Help=This field indicates whether or not prepayments will be made for payments that occur on the payment exclusion date. If the Prepayment Required box is selected, payments that would normally be made on the payment exclusion date are made on the previous payment date, according to the governing delivery pattern. For example, if a participant is scheduled to receive an unemployment insurance payment on the last Thursday of every month, and that Thursday falls on a holiday in a particular month, i.e., a payment exclusion date, selecting 'prepayment required' will result in that participant receiving two payments on the Thursday of the previous month.
