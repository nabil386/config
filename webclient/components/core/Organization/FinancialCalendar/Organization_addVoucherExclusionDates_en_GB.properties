Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create exclusion dates for vouchers. These exclusion dates indicate periods where the organisation will not issue vouchers.

PageTitle.StaticText1=New Exclusion Dates 

ActionControl.Label.Save=Save
ActionControl.Label.Save.Help=The Save action creates a new record from the information entered on the page.

ActionControl.Label.Cancel=Cancel
ActionControl.Label.Cancel.Help=The Cancel action dismisses the page.

Field.Label.DateFrom=Date From
Field.Label.DateFrom.Help=Start date of the voucher exclusion period. A period can be one day or several days in a row. Note that the Date From cannot be in the past, i.e., you cannot set up a voucher exclusion period starting on a date before the current date on the system. Note that the system will not allow the dates of voucher exclusion periods to overlap one another.
Field.Label.DateTo=Date To
Field.Label.DateTo.Help=Last date of the voucher exclusion period. Note that the system will not allow the dates of voucher exclusion periods to overlap one another.
Field.Label.Reason=Reason
Field.Label.Reason.Help=Reason for the voucher exclusion date, e.g., public holiday. Your system administrator can add a new reason for a voucher exclusion date to this drop-down list via the Code Tables page (see "Code Tables" in the C\u00FAram Administration Guide). 
Field.Label.Prepayment=Prepayment Required
Field.Label.Prepayment.Help=This field indicates whether or not prepayments will be made for vouchers scheduled to be issued on the voucher exclusion date. If the Prepayment Required box is selected, vouchers that would normally be issued on the exclusion date are issued on the previous issue date, according to the governing delivery pattern. For example, if a participant is scheduled to receive vouchers on the last Thursday of every month, and that Thursday falls on a holiday in a particular month, i.e., a payment exclusion date, selecting 'prepayment required' will result in that participant receiving two vouchers on the Thursday of the previous month.
