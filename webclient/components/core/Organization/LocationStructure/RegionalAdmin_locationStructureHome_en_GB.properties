Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view the details of the location structure. The locations of the organisation are the work places of its users. Locations can also be public offices where the public can interact with the organisation. All locations have an address. Note, however, there can be multiple locations at the same address. C\u00FAram provides an organisation with the ability to administer locations. Regional administration provides the organisation with the ability to partition some or all of its administration functions across many lines.
