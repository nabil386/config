Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create an organisation unit case approval check.  A case approval check is a review of a case submitted for approval by a caseworker. Once all of the initial evidence for a case has been gathered by a caseworker, the case is typically submitted for supervisor approval. However, depending on the experience of the caseworker or the estimated cost of the case, you may want the system to automatically approve the case. To achieve this, C\u00FAram allows you to set case approval checks for organisation units. These case approval checks allow you to define the percentage of cases in an organisation unit that should be reviewed by the supervisor.

Field.Label.Percentage=Percentage
Field.Label.Percentage.Help=Percentage of the organisation unit's cases that are to be checked for approval. For example, if you enter 20 percent, then for every 100 user cases submitted for approval, 20 of those organisation unit cases must be checked manually by a supervisor.
Field.Label.Cost=Estimated Cost
Field.Label.Cost.Help=Estimated cost of an organisation unit's submitted cases that applies to the above "Percentage". Any case at or below this estimated cost need only be checked for approval if within the percentage of cases to be checked. For example, if you enter a percentage of 20 and an estimated cost of $200, then only 20 percent of submitted cases costing $200 or less need to be manually checked for approval. Note, however that all cases above the $200 estimated cost need to be checked for approval.
Field.Label.Applies=Applies to all Products
Field.Label.Applies.Help=This field indicates whether the organisation unit case approval check should be applied to all products. If you select all products, then all of the organisation unit's cases submitted for approval need to be checked.
Field.Label.Product=Product
Field.Label.Product.Help=Name of the product to which the case approval check applies. To select a product, press the Search button provided to open the Products pop-up window. Click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of products displayed. If you select a product from the organisation's products, then only the organisation unit's cases governed by that product are reviewed according to the above percentage and estimated cost.
