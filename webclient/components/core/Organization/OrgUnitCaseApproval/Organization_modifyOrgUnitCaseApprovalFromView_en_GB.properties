Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify an organisation unit case approval check.  A case approval check is a review of a case submitted for approval by a caseworker. Once all of the initial evidence for a case has been gathered by a caseworker, the case is typically submitted for supervisor approval. However, depending on the experience of the caseworker or the estimated cost of the case, you may want the system to automatically approve the case. To achieve this, C\u00FAram allows you to set case approval checks for organisation units. These case approval checks allow you to define the percentage of cases in an organisation unit that should be reviewed by the supervisor.
