Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a currency exchange rate. A currency exchange rate is the value of one currency in relation to another. Currency exchange rates allow your organisation to convert financial amounts that are in a currency different from your organisation's base currency. Your organisation will need to monitor currency exchange rates for all currencies involved in the organisation's financial transactions.
