Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of the currency exchange rates recorded in the system. A currency exchange rate is the value of one currency in relation to another. Currency exchange rates allow your organization to convert financial amounts that are in a currency different from your organization's base currency. Your organization will need to monitor currency exchange rates for all currencies involved in the organization's financial transactions.
