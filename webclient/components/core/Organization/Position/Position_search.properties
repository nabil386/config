Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to search for positions that are recorded in the system. A position defines a post of employment within the organization, e.g., Social Worker 1, Social Worker 2. All positions are assigned to an organization unit. In turn, system users are assigned a position. A user's assigned position not only defines the user's employment, but it also defines the user's organization unit in the organization hierarchy, as well as the user's manager in the organization reporting hierarchy.
