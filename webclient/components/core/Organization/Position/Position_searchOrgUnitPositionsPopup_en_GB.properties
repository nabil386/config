Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to select a position from the list of positions that are recorded in the system. A position defines a post of employment within the organisation, e.g., Social Worker 1, Social Worker 2. All positions are assigned to an organisation unit. In turn, system users are assigned a position. A user's assigned position not only defines the user's employment, but it also defines the user's organisation unit in the organisation hierarchy, as well as the user's manager in the organisation reporting hierarchy.
