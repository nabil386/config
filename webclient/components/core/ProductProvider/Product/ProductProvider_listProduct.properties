Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of products for a product provider. A product is either a benefit offered to eligible participants or a liability issued to liable participants. Examples of products include child care and training. Product maintenance is handled as part of application administration. When a product is added, it is associated with a product provider and is automatically added to the selected product provider's list of products. Note that a product provider must already be registered to be selected as the provider for a product.
