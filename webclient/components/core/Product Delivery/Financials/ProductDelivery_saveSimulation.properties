Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to save a simulation. When a payment is simulated, the system retrieves the financial components created when the case was activated, or last reassessed, and rolls them forward until the date entered by the user is reached. It then generates a simulation of the payment for that week or for the delivery period of the case. The system also calculates the amount, payment period, and effective date of the payment.
