Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a decision using a static rules tree. The static rules tree is a fully expanded view of the rules hierarchy which cannot be collapsed. All rules marked in black are results that comply with the evidence rules; all rules marked in red are rules that have failed. Your organization has the option to turn on or off the "highlight on failure" rules property.

Cluster.Title.Rules=Rules
Cluster.Title.Rules.Help=The Rules panel displays the rules associated with the decision. These rules are entered on the system by a rules developer and assigned to a product by a system administrator. The initial rules view consists of the rule groups and rule list groups that are not part of an objective, all objective information, and all failed rules that are marked as summary items. Success and failure icons are displayed for each rule artifact to indicate whether or not the rule artifact has been executed successfully. You can view the evidence used by each rule by clicking on the success or failure icon displayed for that rule. The Evidence Used by Rule page opens in a new window and displays the list of evidence used by the rule. The system provides the option to change the initial rules view. You can view all of the rules in an expandable/collapsible tree view or in a static tree view
