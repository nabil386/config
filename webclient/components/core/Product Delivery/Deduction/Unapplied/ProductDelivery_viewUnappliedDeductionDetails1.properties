Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view applied deduction details. There are three categories of deduction; applied, un-applied, and third party. An applied deduction is a monetary amount that is deducted from a person's benefit amount payment and is applied toward an outstanding liability the person owes to the organization. An un-applied deduction is a standalone deduction that is deducted from a person's benefit payment. Un-applied deductions are used to recoup monies paid out by the organization. For example, an un-applied deduction can be created to recoup a one-off emergency payment to a participant. A third party deduction is a deduction that is used to pay off bills or charges owed to a third party. A person may opt to apportion their benefits in this way to budget for their household or to clear an existing liability.
