Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to select the category of deduction you wish to create against the case. There are three categories of deduction: applied, un-applied, and third party. An applied deduction is an amount that is deducted from a person's benefit payment and used to pay off an outstanding liability owed to the organization. For example, $10 of a person's benefit payment can be applied toward an overpayment that was previously issued to that person. An un-applied deduction is a deduction amount that is not applied toward an existing debt but is deducted from a participant's benefit payment. For example, if a person is previously issued a one-off emergency payment, an amount can be stored on the system and deducted from the person's benefit payment. A third party deduction is an amount that is deducted from a benefit payment and used to pay off charges, costs, or debts owed to a third party. A person may opt to apportion their benefits in this way to budget for their household or to clear an existing bill.
