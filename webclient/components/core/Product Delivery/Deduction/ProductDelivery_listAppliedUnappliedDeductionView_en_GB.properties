Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of applied and un-applied deductions recorded on the system. An applied deduction is an amount that is deducted from a person's benefit amount payment and immediately applied toward an outstanding liability the person owes to the organisation. For example, $10 per week of a person's benefit payment can be applied toward an repaying an overpayment that was previously issued to that person. An un-applied deduction is a deduction that not applied toward an existing liability but is deducted from a person's benefit payment. Un-applied deductions are used to make a general refund to the organisation. For example, an un-applied deduction can be created to recoup a one-off emergency payment to a participant.
