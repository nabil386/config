Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to override the maximum deduction rate. Overriding the maximum deduction rate indicates that, for the purposes of this product delivery case, you wish to ignore the maximum deduction rate set during system administration for the product governing this case. For example, there are three deductions created on a case: rent, gas, and electricity. Processing the electricity deduction will result in the total deduction amount exceeding the maximum rate defined for the product. A user and a participant may agree to allow the electricity deduction to be processed. To cater for this, the maximum deduction rate can be overridden.
