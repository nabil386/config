Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to deactivate a deduction. An active deduction can be deactivated. An activated deduction can be deactivated by a system user. A user may decide to deactivate active deductions to ensure that only deductions with a higher priority are processed. For example, if a user notices that all deductions cannot be processed because there is an insufficient amount left on the benefit payment, the user can deactivate deductions of a lesser importance. When a deduction is deactivated, the related deduction financial component record is expired. Each time a deduction is deactivated, the deactivation is recorded on the deduction history.
