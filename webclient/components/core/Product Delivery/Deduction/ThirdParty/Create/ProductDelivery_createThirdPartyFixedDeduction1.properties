Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a third party deduction for a fixed amount. A third party deduction is an amount that is deducted from a person's benefit payment and used to pay off charges, costs, or debts owed to a third party who is registered on the system as a participant. For example, a portion of a person's benefit payments can be paid to a registered electricity supplier. Third party deductions can be based on a fixed amount or a variable amount. A fixed amount is a set amount of money that is deducted from a person's benefit payment. A variable amount is a percentage that is deducted from a person's benefit payment.
