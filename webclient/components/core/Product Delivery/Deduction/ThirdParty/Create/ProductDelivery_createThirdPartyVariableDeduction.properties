Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a third party deduction for a variable amount. A third party deduction is an amount that is deducted from a person's benefit payment and used to pay off charges, costs, or debts owed to a third party who is registered as a participant on the system. For example, a portion of a person's benefit payments can be paid to a registered electricity supplier. Variable deductions can be created against an individual case component or against all components for the case. A variable deduction that is assigned to a specific component will only be deducted from the part of the benefit payment issued in respect of that component. If a component is not specified, the deduction is automatically assigned to all components for the case and is deducted from the total benefit payment amount. If there is more than one nominee on the case, the deduction is split per nominee to cover the total deduction percentage. For example, John Smith receives one benefit component and Linda Smith receives another benefit component for a case. The variable deduction to be deducted from the benefit payment is 20%. When payments are generated in respect of the components, 20% is deducted from the payment issued to John Smith and 20% is deducted from the payment issued to Linda Smith.
