Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to reactive a product delivery case. Closed cases or cases which are pending closure can be reactivated. For example, a person's benefits may be discontinued once the person is in regular employment. If that person is made redundant from the new employer, and the person is once again eligible for benefits, the existing product delivery case can be reactivated.
