Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to unsuspend a case. It may be necessary for the organization to suspend an active product delivery case. For example, the organization may suspend a person's benefits if it suspects that the person is committing benefit fraud. The suspended case can be unsuspended if necessary. If, for example, the organization later discovers that the person suspected of benefit fraud is innocent. In this case, the suspension can be reversed.
