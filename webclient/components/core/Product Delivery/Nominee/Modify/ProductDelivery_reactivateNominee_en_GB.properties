Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to reactivate an expired nominee. If a participant's role of nominee is terminated and case components are no longer assigned to that nominee, the organisation may wish to re establish the participant as the primary nominee for the case. For example, if the primary client of the case is sick and cannot collect benefit payments, he or she may nominate a family member to temporarily collect payments until he or she is recovered. Once the primary client is recovered, he or she becomes the primary nominee for the case again, and the family member's role of nominee is expired or terminated. If it becomes necessary to assign payments to the family member again, for example, if the primary client falls ill again, the organisation can reactivate the expired nominee and he or she will again be the primary nominee on the case.
