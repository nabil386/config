Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to search for a nominee who is registered as an employer participant.  A nominee is a participant who is nominated to receive payments on behalf of the primary case client. For example, you can select the maximum personal component of a person's sickness benefit case to be delivered to the person's employer. This might be necessary if the person's employer continues to pay the person when the person is on sick leave and in receipt of sickness benefit payments.
