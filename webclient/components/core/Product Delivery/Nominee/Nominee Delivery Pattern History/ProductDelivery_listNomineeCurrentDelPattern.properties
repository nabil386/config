Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of the nominee delivery patterns recorded in the system. Nominee delivery patterns are used to create financial schedules for each case component. The case component assigned to the nominee is delivered to the nominee according to this financial schedule. Financial schedules are called financial components. Where a case component is the financial objective, a financial component is a schedule to meet that objective. For example, a nominee is scheduled to receive payments in check form at the start of every month. The eligible case component is max personal with a weekly rate of $70.
