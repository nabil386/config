Help.PageDescription=Case reassessment reevaluates payments or bills when there is change in circumstance or evidence recorded on the case. Case reassessment can result in over and underpayments being created on the case. For example, if John Smith is originally paid $50, but a change in evidence makes him eligible for $40, John Smith is sent a bill for $10 to rectify the overpayment. Case reassessment is performed automatically at different points of the product delivery case lifecycle. Before any payment is authorized on a case, reassessment occurs automatically to determine if there has been any change in evidence or certification. Certification validates evidence over a set time period.

Both a "normal" and a "reconcile" reassessment recalculate the invoice sent to a participant based on changing evidence; however, a reconcile reassessment also recalculates the invoice sent to the participant according to the amount previously paid by the participant and according to related payments and receipts.
