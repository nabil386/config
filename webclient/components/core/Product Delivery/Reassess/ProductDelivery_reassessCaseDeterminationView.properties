Help.PageDescription=This page allows a user to reassess a product delivery case which uses Curam Express Rule sets. Case reassessment reevaluates payments or bills when there is change in circumstance or evidence recorded on the case. Case reassessment can result in over and underpayments being created on the case. For example, if John Smith is originally paid $50, but a change in evidence makes him eligible for $40, John Smith is sent a bill for $10 to rectify the overpayment.Payments and bills created to rectify over and underpayments are automatically issued to the nominee who received the original payment amount.
