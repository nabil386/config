The record meeting minutes wizard assists users in capturing the details of a meeting and issuing meeting minutes to attendees and other interested parties. Each step in the wizard is optional, providing a flexible approach to capturing key information. The record meeting minutes wizard also supports work-in-progress minutes, allowing pieces of information to be recorded all at once or over a period of time. The meeting details are pre-populated by the information entered when the meeting is scheduled.
