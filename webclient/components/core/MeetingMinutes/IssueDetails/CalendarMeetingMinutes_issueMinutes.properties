Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to issue meeting minutes for a scheduled meeting. Once the meeting minutes are recorded, the meeting organizer or the user who has recorded the meeting minutes can issue them to any person invited to the meeting. By default, meeting minutes are issued via email with the minutes in an attached PDF document, thus email addresses are required. An informational is displayed when minutes are issued and one or more email addresses are missing or invalid. Meetings can be issued multiple times and a record is maintained of the history of minutes issued. Each time a version of meeting minutes are issued, the meeting minutes are base lined. This allows users to view the actual minutes as they were at the time of issue.
