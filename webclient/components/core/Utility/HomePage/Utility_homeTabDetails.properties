Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a utility's home page. Utilities provide an essential commodity such as electricity, gas, or water. The organization's interaction with utilities typically involves the issuance of payments based on deductions taken from persons' benefit payments. For example, if a person deducts part of a monthly benefit payment for electricity payments, the organization will issue payments to the electricity supply board based on these deductions.
