Field.Label.Sensitivity.Help=Case closure comment sensitivity level. This field indicates user access to any comments entered on closing the case. These comments appear on a case notes list page and on the Previous Comments field when modifying case closure details. Each user on the system is assigned a security level. In order for a user to view or modify case closure comments, that user must have a sensitivity level equal to or higher than the sensitivity level selected in this field. For example, if your sensitivity user level is 3, in order for you to view or modify comments regarding case closure, the case closure must have a sensitivity level of 3 or less.
