Field.Label.EffectiveFrom.Help=Start date of the period during which the evidence is active.
Field.Label.Status=Status
Field.Label.Status.Help=Evidence status, i.e., "active" or "in edit". If you modify evidence with an "Active" status, the system creates a new evidence set with an "In Edit" status, while the original "Active" evidence set remains as is on the system. Should you activate an "In Edit" evidence set with the same "Effective From" date as an "Active" evidence set, the "In Edit" evidence set supersedes the existing "Active" evidence set. The status of the "In Edit" evidence set changes to "Active". By default, the superseded evidence set no longer appears on the Evidence list page; however, your organization can select to display these "Superseded" evidence sets.
