Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a case audit transaction log record. A case audit transaction log is automatically maintained for each case audit. The case audit transaction log is automatically updated whenever the system detects a pre-defined instance of processing for a case audit. For example, if an Auditor is assigned to a Case Audit, the system updates the case audit transaction log to this effect.
