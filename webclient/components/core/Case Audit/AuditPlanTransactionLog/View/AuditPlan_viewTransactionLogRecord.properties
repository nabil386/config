Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view an audit plan transaction log record. A audit plan transaction log is automatically maintained for each audit plan. The audit plan transaction log is automatically updated whenever the system detects a pre-defined instance of processing for an audit plan. For example, when an Audit Plan is created or when Auditors are assigned to an Audit Plan, the system updates the audit plan transaction log to this effect.
