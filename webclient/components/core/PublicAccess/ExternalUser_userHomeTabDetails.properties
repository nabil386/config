Help.PageDescription=This is the Public Access home page. Public access allows external users such as employers and participants to access the C\u00FAram application in a limited fashion. For example, the options available to Unemployment Insurance claimants and employers, are not as comprehensive as those available to case workers and in addition such users cannot create new records or modify existing records. In addition, the claimant can view certain wage history evidence details. Employers do not have access to the case home pages but can view limited case details from the Case List page.
