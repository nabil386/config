List.Title.Tasks.Help=Lists tasks which are due today or in the near future. This period of time can be defined by an administrator. A task is an instruction to carry out an item of work. Tasks are either manually created by a user or automatically created by the system. They are maintained in a user's workspace as part of workflow. Tasks that relate to a case can also be maintained from the case's task list. For example, a task may be created to approve a case that has been submitted for approval. This task would appear on both the user's inbox and on the case's list of tasks.
