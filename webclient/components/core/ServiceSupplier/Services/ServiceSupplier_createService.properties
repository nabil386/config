Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a service for a service supplier. A service is a task that must be performed by a qualified individual or body. Each service added for a service supplier must be selected from a list of generic services required by the organization, e.g., eye examinations, court translations. This is because several service suppliers may perform the same task for the organization. For example, many doctors may provide medical certifications for the organization. The list of generic services is maintained as part of system administration.
