Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of a service supplier's return line items. A service supplier must submit a return that indicates the cost and the number of participants for whom a service has been provided. The organisation will pay the service supplier based on this return and the payment will be issued as part of case processing. Note that a service supplier return line item indicates the cost of providing the service to a single participant.
