Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a return for a service supplier. A service supplier will make a return to the organisation in respect of a number of participants for whom services have been provided. For example, a registered doctor will make a return to the organisation in respect of the number of persons for whom the doctor provided medical examinations. In order to compensate the service supplier for their services, these returns must be registered on the system, validated, and processed. Return processing ensures that a case is created, whether manually or by the system, for each of the return line items of a return. These return line items are the individual services provided by the service supplier, e.g. each medical examination as in the example above.
