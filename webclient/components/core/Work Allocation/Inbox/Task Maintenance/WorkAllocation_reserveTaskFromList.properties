Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to reserve a task from a list. In order to action the task, a user must first reserve the task. Reserving the task removes the task from the Inbox of all users except that of the user who has reserved the task. This makes the task exclusively available to that user. The task moves from the user's assigned tasks list to his or her reserved tasks list.
