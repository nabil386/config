Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to reserve a task. In order to action a task, a user must first reserve the task. This page displays a list of the tasks, with a status of Open, that the user has reserved. Once a task is reserved by a user, it no longer appears in the inbox of other users. Reserving a task moves the task from the user's assigned task list to the reserved task list.
