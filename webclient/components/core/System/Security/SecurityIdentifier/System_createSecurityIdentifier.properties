Field.Label.Type.Help=Security identifier type, i.e., field, function, product. Field level security allows you to secure a particular field on a server interface. The security identifier name must exactly match the field on the interface. If the user does not have privileges to view a secured field, four asterisks are displayed. Function level security allows you to secure a particular function, e.g., viewing bank details. If the user does not have privileges to perform a particular function, an error message is displayed. Product level security allows you to secure a particular product, e.g., creating a case. If the user does not have privileges to access a product, an error message is displayed. If a user is using a wizard, e.g., creating a case and they do not have the required privileges, an error page is displayed. If you select "product", your new security ID is displayed on the Product Security Identifier pop-up window. You can select this product security identifier as part of maintaining product security.
