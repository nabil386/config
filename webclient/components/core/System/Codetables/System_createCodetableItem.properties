Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to add a code table item to an application code table. Each code table item represents a selection in a drop-down field. The bulk of code table information is contained within code table items. A code table item contains the actual code that will be stored in the application database when that code table item is selected in a drop-down field. In addition, it contains a description, which is the text that will actually be displayed in a drop-down field, and the language setting, which contains information relating to the localization of the code table item.

Field.Label.Code=Technical ID (Code)
Field.Label.Code.Help=This is the code that will be stored in the application database when a code table item is selected in a drop-down field. This field applies to the code table item that is being created.
Field.Label.Description=Item Name
Field.Label.Description.Help=The text that will actually be displayed in the drop-down field. This field applies to the code table item that is being created.
Field.Label.Annotation=Annotation
Field.Label.Annotation.Help=Notes about the code table item. This field applies to the code table item that is being created.
Field.Label.Selectable=Selectable
Field.Label.Selectable.Help=Indicates whether or not this code item is selectable.  If this indicator is set, then this code table item will appear in the drop-down field populated by the parent code table.  If this indicator is not set, the code table item will not appear in the drop-down field. This field applies to the code table item that is being created.
Field.Label.Language=Language
Field.Label.Language.Help=The locale of the code table item. Note that although this setting is named "Language" in order to make it more understandable, it actually refers to a locale, which contains both language and country information. Examples of locales include en-US (US English), en-GB (UK English), and es-US (US Spanish). By using locales, the C\u00FAram application can display different drop-down lists for users with different locales. For example, if a user's locale is set to US-Spanish, a drop-down field for the days of the week can display the values "Lunes", "Martes", "Jueves", etc. Conversely, if another user's locale is set to US English, then the same drop-down field can display the values "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", etc. This field applies to the code table item that is being created.
Field.Label.SortOrder=Sort Order
Field.Label.SortOrder.Help=Sort order of the code table item.  This indicates the position that the code table item will occupy in the drop-down list.
