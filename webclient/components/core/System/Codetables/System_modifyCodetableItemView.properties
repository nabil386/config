PageTitle.StaticText1=Edit Item
PageTitle.StaticText1.Help=This page allows you to modify a code table item. Each code table item represents a selection in a drop-down field. The bulk of code table information is contained within code table items. A code table item contains the actual code that will be stored in the application database when that code table item is selected in a drop-down field. In addition, it contains a description, which is the text that will actually be displayed in a drop-down field, and the language setting, which contains information relating to the localization of the code table item.

Cluster.Title.TechDesc=Technical Information

Field.Label.Code=Technical ID (Code)
Field.Label.Code.Help=Code abbreviation of the description of the code table item. For example, if you were to assign the word 'female' the code 'F', the 'F', rather than 'female', is stored on the database for each female registered with the system.
Field.Label.Description=Item Name
Field.Label.Description.Help=Information that is displayed in a drop-down field. For example, if you have a code 'F' with a description 'female', it is the description 'female' that is displayed to users of the system.
Field.Label.Annotation=Annotation
Field.Label.Annotation.Help=Free text space for adding notes on a code table item.
Field.Label.Selectable=Selectable
Field.Label.Selectable.Help=This field indicates whether or not the code table item is selectable. A selectable code table item is displayed on any drop-down list associated with the code table.
Field.Label.Language=Language
Field.Label.Language.Help=The locale of the code table item. Note that although this field is named "Language" in order to make it more understandable, it actually refers to a locale, which contains both language and country information. Examples of locales include en-US (US English), en-GB (UK English), and es-US (US Spanish). By using locales, the C\u00FAram application can display different drop-down lists for users with different locales. For example, if a user's locale is set to US-Spanish, a drop-down field for the days of the week can display the values "Lunes", "Martes", "Jueves", etc. Conversely, if another user's locale is set to US English, then the same drop-down field can display the values "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", etc.
Field.Label.SortOrder=Sort Order
Field.Label.SortOrder.Help=Sort order of the code table item.  This indicates the position that the code table item will occupy in the drop-down list.
