Help.PageDescription=This page allows to you view a code table and its subsidiary code table items. Code tables contain codes for items that appear in C\u00FAram drop-down fields. Code tables are used to save space in the C\u00FAram database; by storing drop-down field selections as codes rather than the full text of the selection, a great deal of space can be saved in the database. For example, rather than storing the ethnicity "American Indian or Alaskan Native" in the database, the application can store the code "ETH4". Code tables also enable the localization of drop-down fields; localization allows drop-down fields to contain values appropriate to a user's language and dialect. The information that can be stored for a code table includes a code table name and the default code (the default code specifies the code table item that a drop-down field defaults to).  A code table is made up of a number of code table items; each code table item represents a selection in a drop-down field. The bulk of code table information is contained within code table items. A code table item contains the actual code that will be stored in the application database when that code table item is selected in a drop-down field. In addition, it contains a description, which is the text that will actually be displayed in a drop-down field, and the language setting, which contains information relating to the localization of the code table item.
