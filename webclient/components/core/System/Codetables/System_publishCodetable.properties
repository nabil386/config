Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to publish changes that have been made to application code tables and code table items. Publishing code table changes updates the code table settings currently in use by the system.    Code tables contain codes for items that appear in C\u00FAram drop-down fields; each code table item represents a selection in a drop-down field. The bulk of code table information is contained within code table items. A code table item contains the actual code that will be stored in the application database when that code table item is selected in a drop-down field.   Changes made to code tables or code table items are not propagated to the application's drop-down fields until the changes are "published" (or until the application server is rebooted). Note, however, any changes you make are visible on the relevant code table page before the changes are published, even though these changes will not yet be visible in the application's drop-down fields.
