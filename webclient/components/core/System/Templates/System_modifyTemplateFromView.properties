Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify a template record. Templates are pro forma documents and letters printed by C\u00FAram using a combination of XML and XSL style sheets. A particular set of XML tags has been defined to allow any data in C\u00FAram to be represented as XML. All XML is generated from entities or structures defined in the C\u00FAram application model. XSL style sheets are used to format the XML data for printing. (Please see the "C\u00FAram XML Guide" for information.) The XSL style sheets that you create (using any XSL editor) are stored in the C\u00FAram database.
