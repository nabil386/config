Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify a batch process. Batch processes are "mini-programs" that execute on your application server. Batch processes are defined as part of the C\u00FAram application development process. The C\u00FAram administration application allows users to request the execution of a batch process on-line. Typically, your organization uses this functionality to allow users to schedule reports. The batch process is not executed immediately, rather, it is placed on a queue that executes when the C\u00FAram Batch Launcher is initiated. By default, all batch processes are displayed on the C\u00FAram client batch process list page; however, it is likely that you do not want users to have access to all of the batch processes. In most cases, on-line users should only have access to the reporting batch processes. You should customize the list of batch process to meet your needs.
