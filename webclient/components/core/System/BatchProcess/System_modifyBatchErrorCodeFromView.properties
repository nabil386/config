Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify the batch error code entered for a batch process. Batch error codes are used to specify the error codes returned by the Batch Launcher in the event of a batch process exception. Batch error codes are identified by a batch error code ID. When a batch process throws an exception, the Batch Launcher compares all batch error code IDs with the error messages thrown by the batch process. If a matching batch error code ID is found, the corresponding batch error code will be returned by the Batch Launcher. For detailed information on the Batch Launcher and other aspects of batch process administration, see the C\u00FAram Batch Processing Guide.
