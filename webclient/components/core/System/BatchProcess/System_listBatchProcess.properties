Help.PageDescription=This page lists the batch processes that are available for execution. Batch processes are executables or "mini-programs" that process a large number of records according to set parameters. Because this can slow down the system, batch processing is usually delayed until the system is offline, e.g., at night. An example of a batch process is DetermineProductDeliveryEligibility. This batch process is used to activate a large number of cases at once and is therefore run as a batch process so as to minimize system delays.
