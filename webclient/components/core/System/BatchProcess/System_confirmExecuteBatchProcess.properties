Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to confirm the execution of a batch process. Batch processes are executables or "mini-programs" that process a large number of records according to set parameters. Because this can slow down the system, batch processing is usually delayed until the system is offline, e.g., at night. An example of a batch process is DetermineProductDeliveryEligibility. This batch process is used to activate a large number of cases at once and is therefore run as a batch process so as to minimize system delays.
