Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a new batch error code in the system. Batch error codes are used to specify the error codes returned by the Batch Launcher in the event of a batch process exception. Batch error codes are identified by a batch error code ID. When a batch process throws an exception, the Batch Launcher compares all batch error code IDs with the error messages thrown by the batch process. If a matching batch error code ID is found, the corresponding batch error code will be returned by the Batch Launcher. For detailed information on the Batch Launcher and other aspects of batch process administration, see the C\u00FAram Batch Processing Guide.

Field.Label.BatchErrorCodeID=Batch Error Code ID
Field.Label.BatchErrorCodeID.Help=The batch error code ID is a text description of the error that is compared with batch process error messages.  If a batch error code ID that matches a batch error message is found, the corresponding Batch Error Code will be returned by the Batch Launcher (the program that is used to run Batch Process requests). For more information on batch process administration, see the C\u00FAram Batch Processing Guide.
