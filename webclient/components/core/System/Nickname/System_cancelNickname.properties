Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to confirm the deletion of a nickname. A thesaurus of alternative names for an individual can be managed as part of system administration. The thesaurus allows the organization to define common nicknames that are associated with a name. For example, a person with the name "James" may also go by the name "Jimmy" or "Jamie". Defined nicknames can be used as search criteria when searching for a person and/or prospect person.
