subfolder.title.financials.Help=Case financials are the payments and bills issued for eligible and active product delivery cases. These financials are generated as a result of case processing, including the generation of payments and bills for eligible case components. Case financials also include account maintenance on a case such as the allocation of funds from a payment toward a bill, and receipt of payments from case participants in respect of their bills.

page.title.communications.Help=All communications relate to a participant or a case. The place a communication is created from determines whether that communication is related to a participant or a case. Communications created within a case automatically relate to that case. This includes communications created from a case participant's list of communications, a case member's list of communications, or from the communication list for the case itself. Communications created from a participant's list of communications relate to that participant.

folder.title.administration=Administration
folder.title.administration.Help=System administration includes functionality for managing a broad spectrum of elements that impact the operation of the C\u00FAram application. System administration requires some familiarity with technical terms, as certain components of system administration can only be created during application development. For example, the execution of batch processes is requested from the system administration module; however, the batch processes themselves can only be designed and implemented as part of application development.
