page.title.notes.Help=Notes are used to provide additional information about a service plan case. For example, a note may be added to a person's service plan case stating that the person has not been attending meetings and recommending that a home visit be scheduled for the person. A note is entered as free text and can be prioritized and given a sensitivity rating so that the note can only be accessed by certain users.A note cannot be overwritten once it has been created on the system. When a note is modified, the system maintains a note history which includes each version of a note, the time and date the note was entered on the system and the user who made the note modifications.The system will automatically generate notes at specific stages of the product delivery lifecycle. A note is automatically generated and displayed on the case notes list every time a case is suspended, unsuspended, reactivated, or closed.
