page.title.eligibilityruleset.Help= An eligibility rule set is a hierarchical arrangement of nested objects of different types. It defines the set of rules for a specific period of time for a given product and acts itself as a Root of the hierarchy. Several other objects like rule list groups, rule groups, objective list groups, objective groups, objectives, data item assignments, rules, and sub-rule set link, with different combinations fit in the next level.
page.title.rulesdataobjs.Help=Rules Data Objects (RDOs) are UML stereotypes. Related data items are grouped together as attributes within RDOs. The attributes for most RDOs are modeled according to the business logic of social welfare categories, i.e., case details, demographic details, contribution details, means details, dependencies details, and employment details. The attributes for these RDOs are populated and read by the rules engine during rules processing

page.title.subrulesets.Help=Sub-Rule Sets are similar to eligibility rule sets. They are defined independently with an unique Rule Set ID and Name. To avoid replication, they can be invoked multiple times from different eligibility rule sets.
page.title.wrkallocruleset.Help=Work Allocation Rule Sets are similar to Eligibility Rule Sets except that they define rules to determine how tasks are allocated.
