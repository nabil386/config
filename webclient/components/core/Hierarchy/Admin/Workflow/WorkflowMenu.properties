Help.PageDescription=The Workflow Infrastructure supports the automation of business processes and allows work to be routed among individuals and departments. Workflow process definitions describe the sequence of activities that go to make up a business process. An activity is a step in a workflow process. Activities may be automatic, performed using machine resources, or manual, requiring the intervention of a human agent. Transition rules encoded in the workflow process definition determine how work is routed between activities. Allocation rules determine how work is allocated to agents. An allocated item of work is called a task. Agents use the Inbox to view and action the tasks assigned to them. When tasks are actioned, the software application raises events to inform the Workflow Management System that the task has been completed, and that the workflow can resume.

page.title.wdotemplates.Help=Workflow data object templates are templates for workflow data object definitions that are used in multiple workflow process definitions. These templates contain any number of valid workflow data object attributes. For example, a template can be created for case data which includes an attribute for the caseID. Any process definitions which use a workflow data object template will then have access to the data defined by these attributes.
