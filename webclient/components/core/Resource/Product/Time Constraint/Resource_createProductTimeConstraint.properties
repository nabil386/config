Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a time constraint. A product time constraint is a time limit that is applied to a product. Time constraints are related to time limit functionality. For example, a time constraint that applies to appeal processing can be added to a benefit or liability product.

Field.Label.NumberOfDays=Number of Days
Field.Label.NumberOfDays.Help=Time limit in days that applies to the time constraint type selected below. For example, if the number of days is 30 and the time constraint type is "first appeal", the system sets a time limit of 30 days on the "first appeal" time limit.
Field.Label.Type=Type
Field.Label.Type.Help=Start date of the period during which the time constraint is valid.
Field.Label.FromDate=From
Field.Label.FromDate.Help=Time constraint type from the drop-down list of time constraint types, e.g., first appeal, first review. Each time constraint type relates to time limit functionality. When you select this type, the system applies this time limit to the product. Note that this time limit is defined by the number of days entered above. For example, if you select the "first appeal" type, the "first appeal" time limit is applied to the product and this time limit is defined by the number of days.
