Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify a rule set assessment from a list. An assessment is a preliminary test to see whether or not a participant or potential participant is eligible for a product. In order for a case manager to assess product eligibility, you, the administrator, must ensure that the appropriate assessments are on the system. Each of these assessments must be assigned a rule set. When a case manager assesses a participant or potential participant's product eligibility, the rule set is applied to the participant or potential participant's evidence to determine product eligibility. The rule sets assigned to assessments are the same rule sets assigned to the products of the organisation.
