Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a integrate case type. An integrated case type relates to a coded description of the integrated case, e.g., assistance or behavioral. Integrated case types relate to product categories. Product categories are selected when a product is created. During integrated case creation, an integrated case type must be selected and this selection determines the type of products available to the integrated case. For example, if you were to select an assistance integrated case type, then only those products and their evidence forms that have assistance selected as a product category can be created on the integrated case. You can specify additional information that is specific to an integrated case type, i.e., the Integrated Case Home page and Member Home page.
