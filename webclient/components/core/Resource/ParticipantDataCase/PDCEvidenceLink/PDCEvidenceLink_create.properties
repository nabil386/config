Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create evidence metadata and participant data case type evidence link record. Evidence metadata provides configuration data for particular evidence types. Evidence metadata is maintained as part of the application's administration functionality. Evidence records associated with a participant data case type can be shared across multiple integrated or product delivery cases. This is important because information requirements often overlap across products. For example, several products may require income evidence.
