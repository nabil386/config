Cluster.Label.Description=Description
Cluster.Label.Description.Help=Free text space for adding a liability product description.

Cluster.Label.Financial=Financial Details
Field.Label.OverPaymentProcessing=Automatic Overpayment Case Processing
Field.Label.OverPaymentProcessing.Help=To automatically create a case when an under or over payment is discovered during the reassessment of a case governed by the liability product, you must select this selection box. If 'automatic under or over payment processing' is selected, then the application automatically sets up a new over payment case. If it is not selected, then the application notifies a case owner via task notification that an under or over payment has been discovered during reassessment. For liability products, an under payment occurs when the organization under bills a case recipient. An over payment occurs when the organization over bills a case recipient.
Field.Label.AdjustmentRequired=Adjustment Required
Field.Label.AdjustmentRequired.Help=This field indicates whether or not adjustment is required during financial processing. An example of an adjustment is a surcharge; an example of a loan adjustment is the application of interest. If you want the employer bill product to include the calculation of the appropriate surcharges, then select that adjustment is required during financial processing. Likewise, if you want the loan product to include the calculation of the appropriate interest, then select that adjustment is required during financial processing. If you make this selection, the appropriate adjustment values are calculated and added to the invoices issued to the product recipients.
Field.Label.AdjustmentFrequency=Adjustment Frequency
Field.Label.AdjustmentFrequency.Help=If adjustment is required during financial processing, you must enter the frequency indicating how often the financial component of a liability product is adjusted during a payment period. Press the Select a Frequency Pattern button to open the Select a Frequency Pattern pop-up window. From this pop-up window, select the recurrence frequency, e.g., weekly and day of the week on which the liability product is adjusted during a payment period. An example of an adjustment is a surcharge; an example of a loan adjustment is the application of interest. Press the OK button to confirm this frequency or press the Cancel button to cancel the frequency information.
Field.Label.Normal=Normal Reassessment
Field.Label.Normal.Help=By default, all reassessments are reconciled reassessments. To indicate that the reassessment for the liability product should be a normal reassessment, select this selection box. Both a 'normal' and a 'reconcile' reassessment recalculate the invoice sent to a participant based on changing evidence; however, a reconcile reassessment also recalculates the invoice sent to the participant according to the amount previously paid by the participant and according to related payments and receipts. To better understand the difference between normal and reconciled reassessment types, consider the following example comparing the two types. Assume a participant is billed a certain amount each month for a particular liability product; if the product is marked as a 'normal reassessment type', then the participant's future bills are recalculated based solely on the prototypical changing evidence. If the product is not marked as a 'normal reassessment type', then the participant's future bills are recalculated based on the participant's evidence, as well as on the details of the participant's previous payment and receipt records on the system.
Field.Label.OverAllocation=Overallocation
Field.Label.OverAllocation.Help=This field indicates whether or not to override the allocation indicator for cases of the liability product. This option is specifically geared toward liability payments made to the organization that are over the amount billed to a participant of a liability case. In general, a liability is an estimation to be billed to a participant. For example, a participant is billed a certain amount by the organization for the liability product. The participant might find that they owe more than the amount billed. If you select to over allocate, the participant can send in more than originally billed and this amount, the amount the participant sends to the organization, is read on the system as the correct amount to be applied to the case. If you do not select to over allocate, any time a participant pays over the amount they are billed, the amount paid over the bill can not be applied to the case until reassessment.

Field.Label.FixedCost=Fixed Cost
Field.Label.FixedCost.Help=Fixed cost of the liability product. The estimated cost of a liability product can either be fixed or calculated. If the estimated cost is 'fixed', enter an amount in the space provided. If the estimated cost is calculated, select the selection box provided (see Cost Calculated field below).
Field.Label.Calculated=Cost Calculated
Field.Label.Calculated.Help=This field indicates whether the cost of the liability product is calculated. Note that a 'calculated' estimated cost for the product is based on the values entered into the product evidence. Note also that you do not have to enter an estimated cost.

Cluster.Label.Certification=Certification Details
Field.Label.CertificationRequired=Required
Field.Label.CertificationRequired.Help=You can indicate whether or not the liability product requires certification. Certification verifies that a case recipient meets the conditions for receipt of a product.
Field.Label.CertificationFrequency=Frequency
Field.Label.CertificationFrequency.Help=Frequency determining when the case recipient of the liability product must certify the case recipient's product eligibility. Certification verifies that a participant meets the conditions for receipt of a product. Press the Select a Frequency Pattern button to open the Select a Frequency Pattern pop-up window. From this pop-up window, select the recurrence frequency, e.g., weekly and day of the week on which the case recipient of the liability product must certify the case recipient's product eligibility. Press the OK button to confirm this frequency or press the Cancel button to cancel the frequency information.
Field.Label.GracePeriod=Grace Period
Field.Label.GracePeriod.Help=If certification is required, the maximum number of days the case recipient of the liability product has to provide additional certification after the case recipient's latest certification has expired.

Cluster.Label.EligibleParticipants=Eligible Participant Types

Cluster.Label.SecurityRestrictions=Security Restrictions
Field.Label.LocationSecurityLevel=Location Security Level
Field.Label.LocationSecurityLevel.Help=Location based case security can be activated at the product level by selecting the appropriate location type the users are restricted to. For example, you can select that users are restricted to modify case details governed by the liability product within the county location type. Thus, users can only modify case details for cases owned by users within their own county.
Field.Label.ApproveRights=Approve Rights
Field.Label.ApproveRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to approve cases governed by the liability product. By adding a security identifier to the Approve Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can approve or reject cases governed by that product. To add a security identifier to the Approve Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Approve Rights field, then only the case supervisor can approve or reject cases governed by that product.
Field.Label.CreateRights=Create Rights
Field.Label.CreateRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to create cases governed by the liability product. By adding a security identifier to the Create Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can create cases governed by that product. To add a security identifier to the Create Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Create Rights field, then any user can create cases for that product. Note that adding case evidence is considered a 'maintain' function. Thus, even if a user has security rights to create a case for a specific product, if security is in place for 'maintaining' cases for that same product, and the user does not have product security privileges to 'maintain', the user cannot enter evidence during case creation, nor check case eligibility. For information on 'maintain' product security, see the following Maintain Rights field.
Field.Label.MaintainRights=Maintain Rights
Field.Label.MaintainRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to maintain cases governed by the liability product. By adding a security identifier to the Maintain Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can maintain cases governed by that product. A user with 'maintain' rights can manage case evidence, manage case certification, and check case eligibility. To add a security identifier to the Maintain Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Maintain Rights field, then any user can maintain cases for that product.
Field.Label.ReadRights=Read Rights
Field.Label.ReadRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to read (view) cases governed by the liability product. By adding a security identifier to the Read Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can read (view) cases governed by that product. To add a security identifier to the Read Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Read Access Rights field, then any user can read cases for that product.
