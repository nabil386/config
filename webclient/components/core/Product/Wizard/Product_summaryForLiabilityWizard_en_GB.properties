Cluster.Label.Financial=Financial Details
Field.Label.OverAllocation=Over Allocation
Field.Label.OverAllocation.Help=This field indicates whether or not to override the allocation indicator for cases of the liability product. This option is specifically geared toward liability payments made to the organisation that are over the amount billed to a participant of a liability case. In general, a liability is an estimation to be billed to a participant. For example, a participant is billed a certain amount by the organisation for the liability product. The participant might find that they owe more than the amount billed. If you select to over allocate, the participant can send in more than originally billed and this amount, the amount the participant sends to the organisation, is read on the system as the correct amount to be applied to the case. If you do not select to over allocate, any time a participant pays over the amount they are billed, the amount paid over the bill can not be applied to the case until reassessment.
Field.Label.AdjustmentRequired=Adjustment Required
Field.Label.AdjustmentRequired.Help=This field indicates whether or not adjustment is required during financial processing. An example of an adjustment is a surcharge; an example of a loan adjustment is the application of interest. If you want the employer bill product to include the calculation of the appropriate surcharges, then select that adjustment is required during financial processing. Likewise, if you want the loan product to include the calculation of the appropriate interest, then select that adjustment is required during financial processing. If you make this selection, the appropriate adjustment values are calculated and added to the invoices issued to the product recipients.
Field.Label.OverPaymentProcessing=Automatic Over Payment Case Processing
Field.Label.OverPaymentProcessing.Help=To automatically create a case when an under or over payment is discovered during the reassessment of a case governed by the liability product, you must select this selection box. If 'automatic under or over payment processing' is selected, then the application automatically sets up a new over payment case. If it is not selected, then the application notifies a case owner via task notification that an under or over payment has been discovered during reassessment. For liability products, an under payment occurs when the organisation under bills a case recipient. An over payment occurs when the organisation over bills a case recipient.
Field.Label.Normal=Normal Reassessment
Field.Label.Normal.Help=By default, all reassessments are reconciled reassessments. To indicate that the reassessment for the liability product should be a normal reassessment, select this selection box. Both a 'normal' and a 'reconcile' reassessment recalculate the invoice sent to a participant based on changing evidence; however, a reconcile reassessment also recalculates the invoice sent to the participant according to the amount previously paid by the participant and according to related payments and receipts. To better understand the difference between normal and reconciled reassessment types, consider the following example comparing the two types. Assume a participant is billed a certain amount each month for a particular liability product; if the product is marked as a 'normal reassessment type', then the participant's future bills are recalculated based solely on the prototypical changing evidence. If the product is not marked as a 'normal reassessment type', then the participant's future bills are recalculated based on the participant's evidence, as well as on the details of the participant's previous payment and receipt records on the system.
Field.Label.AdjustmentFrequency=Adjustment Frequency
Field.Label.AdjustmentFrequency.Help=If adjustment is required during financial processing, you must enter the frequency indicating how often the financial component of a liability product is adjusted during a payment period. 

Cluster.Title.Cost=Cost
Field.Label.FixedCost=Fixed Cost
Field.Label.FixedCost.Help=Fixed cost of the liability product. The estimated cost of a liability product can either be fixed or calculated. 
Field.Label.Calculated=Cost Calculated
Field.Label.Calculated.Help=This field indicates whether the cost of the liability product is calculated. Note that a 'calculated' estimated cost for the product is based on the values entered into the product evidence. Note also that you do not have to enter an estimated cost.

Cluster.Label.Certification=Certification Details
Field.Label.CertificationRequired=Required
Field.Label.CertificationRequired.Help=You can indicate whether or not the liability product requires certification. Certification verifies that a case recipient meets the conditions for receipt of a product.
Field.Label.CertificationFrequency=Frequency
