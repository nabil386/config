Help.PageDescription=This page allows the user to view an evidence approval check. Evidence approval checks provide an extra step in the apply evidence change process to ensure that the evidence changes are correct. When a user selects to activate evidence or remove evidence, the system determines whether or not the evidence change requires approval from the case supervisor. If approval is required, the case supervisor is notified that the evidence cannot be activated or removed until the case supervisor approves the evidence change. If the person submitting the evidence is the same as the user to whom the evidence approval task will be assigned the evidence is automatically activated.
