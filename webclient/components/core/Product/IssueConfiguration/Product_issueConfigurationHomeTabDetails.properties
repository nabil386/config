An issue is created when a discrepancy arises between evidence provided by the client and verification of that evidence by an employer. A user reviews the issue and adjudicates over which piece of evidence is correct. Generic information is configured for each issue type during system administration. This information is then inherited by the issues that are set up on individual cases.
