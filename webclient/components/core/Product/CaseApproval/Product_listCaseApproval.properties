Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of the product case approval check recorded in the system. A product case approval check is a review of a case submitted for approval by a caseworker. Once all of the initial evidence for a case has been gathered by a caseworker, the case is typically submitted for supervisor approval. However, depending on the experience of the caseworker or the estimated cost of the case, you may want the system to automatically approve the case. To achieve this, C\u00FAram allows you to set case approval checks for products. These case approval checks allow you to define the number of cases in a particular product that should be reviewed by the supervisor.

Field.Label.Percentage=Percentage
Field.Label.Percentage.Help=Percentage of the product cases that are to be checked for approval. For example, if you enter 20%, then for every 100 cases of a specific product submitted for approval, 20 of those product cases must be checked manually.
Field.Label.Cost=Estimated Cost
Field.Label.Cost.Help=Estimated cost of a product's submitted cases that applies to the above "Percentage". Any case at or below this estimated cost need only be checked for approval if within the percentage of cases to be checked. For example, if you enter a percentage of 20 and an estimated cost of $200, then only 20% of submitted cases costing $200 or less need to be manually checked for approval. Note, however, that all of a product's cases above the $200 estimated cost need to be checked for approval.
