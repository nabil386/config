Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a product case approval check. A product case approval check is a review of a case submitted for approval by a caseworker. Once all of the initial evidence for a case has been gathered by a caseworker, the case is typically submitted for supervisor approval. However, depending on the experience of the caseworker or the estimated cost of the case, you may want the system to automatically approve the case. To achieve this, C\u00FAram allows you to set case approval checks for products. These case approval checks allow you to define the number of cases in a particular product that should be reviewed by the supervisor.
