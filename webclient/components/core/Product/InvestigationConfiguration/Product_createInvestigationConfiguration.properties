Field.Title.MDTSharing.Help=Indicates that Sharing is applicable for this case

Field.Title.MDTType.Help=The multidisciplinary team type can either be "predefined" or "define from social enterprise folder". Predefined multidisciplinary teams are typically matched to case types with predefined goals. For example, the predefined goals of high risk cases such as domestic abuse investigation are to assess the risk of re-assault or violence and take the necessary steps to protect any persons in harms way. Families with complex and ongoing needs require a multidisciplinary team who understands their personal circumstances. For example, an ongoing case aimed at assisting a child who was in a abusive situation requires team members who have established relationships with the child.

Field.Label.ApproveRights=Approve Rights
Field.Label.ApproveRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to approve cases governed by the investigation. By adding a security identifier to the Approve Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can approve or reject cases governed by that product. To add a security identifier to the Approve Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Approve Rights field, then only the case supervisor can approve or reject cases governed by that product.
Field.Label.CreateRights=Create Rights
Field.Label.CreateRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to create cases governed by the investigation. By adding a security identifier to the Create Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can create cases governed by that product. To add a security identifier to the Create Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Create Rights field, then any user can create cases for that product. Note that adding case evidence is considered a 'maintain' function. Thus, even if a user has security rights to create a case for a specific product, if security is in place for 'maintaining' cases for that same product, and the user does not have product security privileges to 'maintain', the user cannot enter evidence during case creation, nor check case eligibility. For information on 'maintain' product security, see the following Maintain Rights field.
Field.Label.MaintainRights=Maintain Rights
Field.Label.MaintainRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to maintain cases governed by the investigation. By adding a security identifier to the Maintain Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can maintain cases governed by that product. A user with 'maintain' rights can manage case evidence, manage case certification, and check case eligibility. To add a security identifier to the Maintain Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Maintain Rights field, then any user can maintain cases for that product.
Field.Label.ReadRights=Read Rights
Field.Label.ReadRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to read (view) cases governed by the investigation. By adding a security identifier to the Read Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can read (view) cases governed by that product. To add a security identifier to the Read Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Read Access Rights field, then any user can read cases for that product.
