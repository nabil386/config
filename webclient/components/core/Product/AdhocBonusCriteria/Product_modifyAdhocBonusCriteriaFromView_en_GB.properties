Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify an ad hoc bonus. An ad hoc bonus is a once-off additional payment that can be issued to a participant. ad hoc bonuses allow the organisation to provide additional assistance to participants who require assistance during certain periods of the year. For example, persons receiving unemployment from the organisation may require additional payments during the Christmas holiday. Note that ad hoc bonus functionality can be activated for all benefit products; however, you cannot add an ad hoc bonus to a product unless the ad hoc bonus functionality has been activated for the product on the system.
