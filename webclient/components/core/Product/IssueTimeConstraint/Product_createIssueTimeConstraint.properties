Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a time constraint for an issue. Time constraints are time limits applied to products and issues. They are used to govern the number of days within which an action must be performed. For example, a time constraint can be configured that indicates the maximum number of days by which an appeal request must be received for an issue that is related to earned income.
