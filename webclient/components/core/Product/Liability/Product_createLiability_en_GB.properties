Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a liability product. A liability product is used by the organisation to receive payment from an eligible participant. One example of a liability product would be a benefit overpayment case, where the organisation has overpaid a benefit recipient. A case based on this product would result in a deduction from the recipient's future benefits.

PageTitle.StaticText1=New Liability Product

ActionControl.Label.Save=Save
ActionControl.Label.Save.Help=The Save action creates a new record from the information entered on the page.
ActionControl.Label.SaveAndNew=Save & New
ActionControl.Label.SaveAndNew.Help=The Save & New action creates a new record from the information entered on the page and resets the page allowing an additional record to be created.

Field.Label.StartDate.Help=Start date of the period during which the liability product is offered by the organisation.
Field.Label.Language=Language
Field.Label.Language.Help=Language to be displayed on the materials surrounding this liability product.
Field.Label.Type=Type
Field.Label.Type.Help=Liability product type, e.g., liability overpayment, employer bill.
Field.Label.EndDate=End Date
Field.Label.EndDate.Help=Last date of the period during which the liability product is offered by the organisation. This field is blank when the liability product is offered indefinitely.
Field.Label.SupplierReturns=Supplier Returns Accepted
Field.Label.SupplierReturns.Help=This field indicates whether returns by a service supplier to the organisation are accepted in respect of a number of participants for whom services have been provided.
Field.Label.ReviewFrequency=Review Frequency
Field.Label.ReviewFrequency.Help=Frequency defining how often the cases of this liability product should be reviewed. Press the Select a Frequency Pattern button to open the Select a Frequency Pattern pop-up window. From this pop-up window, select the recurrence frequency, e.g., weekly and day of the week on which the cases of this product should be reviewed.
Field.Label.CaseHomePage=Case Home Page
Field.Label.CaseHomePage.Help=Case home page format. All case home pages for the liability product use this case home page format.
Field.Label.DateList=Date List
Field.Label.DateList.Help=In this field the assessment engine uses a date list to create case decisions. There are two types of date lists: the event date list and the pattern date list. Both of these date lists define the dates on which the assessment engine calls the rules engine. The event date list is a list of dates provided to the assessment engine; the pattern date list is a list compiled by the assessment engine. Products that use the event date list will require a list of dates on which the rules engine is called. Products that use the pattern date list will not require a list of dates, as the assessment engine compiles this date list automatically using the nominee delivery pattern and re-rate frequency.

Cluster.Label.Description=Description
Cluster.Label.Description.Help=Free text space for adding a liability product description.

Cluster.Label.Financial=Financial Details
Field.Label.OverPaymentProcessing=Automatic Overpayment Case Processing
Field.Label.OverPaymentProcessing.Help=To automatically create a case when an under or over payment is discovered during the reassessment of a case governed by the liability product, you must select this selection box. If 'automatic under or over payment processing' is selected, then the application automatically sets up a new over payment case. If it is not selected, then the application notifies a case owner via task notification that an under or over payment has been discovered during reassessment. For liability products, an under payment occurs when the organisation under bills a case recipient. An over payment occurs when the organisation over bills a case recipient.
Field.Label.RerateFrequency=Re-rate Frequency
Field.Label.RerateFrequency.Help=Frequency indicating how often the rules are applied for a case of this liability product between payment dates. To select a frequency, press the Select a Frequency Pattern button. From the Select a Frequency Pattern pop-up window, select the recurrence frequency, e.g., weekly and day of the week on which the rules are applied for a case of this benefit product between payment dates. This value should be more frequent for products with a high rate of change of evidence, e.g., unemployment assistance, and less frequent for products with a low rate of change of evidence, e.g., old age pensions. Press the OK button to confirm this frequency or press the Cancel button to cancel the frequency information.
Field.Label.AdjustmentRequired=Adjustment Required
Field.Label.AdjustmentRequired.Help=This field indicates whether or not adjustment is required during financial processing. An example of an adjustment is a surcharge; an example of a loan adjustment is the application of interest. If you want the employer liability product to include the calculation of the appropriate surcharges, then select that adjustment is required during financial processing. Likewise, if you want the loan product to include the calculation of the appropriate interest, then select that adjustment is required during financial processing. If you make this selection, the appropriate adjustment values are calculated and added to the invoices issued to the product recipients.
Field.Label.AdjustmentFrequency=Adjustment Frequency
Field.Label.AdjustmentFrequency.Help=If adjustment is required during financial processing, you must enter the frequency indicating how often the financial component of a liability product is adjusted during a payment period. Press the Select a Frequency Pattern button to open the Select a Frequency Pattern pop-up window. From this pop-up window, select the recurrence frequency, e.g., weekly and day of the week on which the liability product is adjusted during a payment period. An example of an adjustment is a surcharge; an example of a loan adjustment is the application of interest. Press the OK button to confirm this frequency or press the Cancel button to cancel the frequency information.
Field.Label.Normal=Normal Reassessment
Field.Label.Normal.Help=By default, all reassessments are reconciled reassessments. To indicate that the reassessment for the liability product should be a normal reassessment, select this selection box. Both a 'normal' and a 'reconcile' reassessment recalculate the invoice sent to a participant based on changing evidence; however, a reconcile reassessment also recalculates the invoice sent to the participant according to the amount previously paid by the participant and according to related payments and receipts. To better understand the difference between normal and reconciled reassessment types, consider the following example comparing the two types. Assume a participant is billed a certain amount each month for a particular liability product; if the product is marked as a 'normal reassessment type', then the participant's future bills are recalculated based solely on the prototypical changing evidence. If the product is not marked as a 'normal reassessment type', then the participant's future bills are recalculated based on the participant's evidence, as well as on the details of the participant's previous payment and receipt records on the system.
Field.Label.OverAllocation=Overallocation
Field.Label.OverAllocation.Help=This field indicates whether or not to override the allocation indicator for cases of the liability product. This option is specifically geared toward liability payments made to the organisation that are over the amount billed to a participant of a liability case. In general, a liability is an estimation to be billed to a participant. For example, a participant is billed a certain amount by the organisation for the liability product. The participant might find that they owe more than the amount billed. If you select to over allocate, the participant can send in more than originally billed and this amount, the amount the participant sends to the organisation, is read on the system as the correct amount to be applied to the case. If you do not select to over allocate, any time a participant pays over the amount they are billed, the amount paid over the bill can not be applied to the case until reassessment.

Cluster.Label.Cost=Cost
Field.Label.FixedCost=Fixed Cost
Field.Label.FixedCost.Help=Fixed cost of the liability product. The estimated cost of a liability product can either be fixed or calculated. If the estimated cost is 'fixed', enter an amount in the space provided. If the estimated cost is calculated, select the selection box provided (see Cost Calculated field below).
Field.Label.Calculated=Cost Calculated
Field.Label.Calculated.Help=This field indicates whether the cost of the liability product is calculated. Note that a 'calculated' estimated cost for the product is based on the values entered into the product evidence. Note also that you do not have to enter an estimated cost.

Cluster.Label.Certification=Certification Details
Field.Label.CertificationRequired=Required
Field.Label.CertificationRequired.Help=You can indicate whether or not the liability product requires certification. Certification verifies that a case recipient meets the conditions for receipt of a product.
Field.Label.CertificationFrequency=Frequency
Field.Label.CertificationFrequency.Help=Frequency determining when the case recipient of the liability product must certify the case recipient's product eligibility. Certification verifies that a participant meets the conditions for receipt of a product. Press the Select a Frequency Pattern button to open the Select a Frequency Pattern pop-up window. From this pop-up window, select the recurrence frequency, e.g., weekly and day of the week on which the case recipient of the liability product must certify the case recipient's product eligibility. Press the OK button to confirm this frequency or press the Cancel button to cancel the frequency information.
Field.Label.GracePeriod=Grace Period
Field.Label.GracePeriod.Help=If certification is required, the maximum number of days the case recipient of the liability product has to provide additional certification after the case recipient's latest certification has expired.

Cluster.Label.EligibleParticipants=Eligible Participant Types
Field.Label.Person=Person
Field.Label.Person.Help=This field indicates whether or not a person participant type is eligible for the liability product. Select this selection box if the person participant type is eligible for this liability product.
Field.Label.Employer=Employer
Field.Label.Employer.Help=This field indicates whether or not an information provider participant type is eligible for the liability product. Select this selection box if the information provider participant type is eligible for this liability product.
Field.Label.Utility=Utility
Field.Label.Utility.Help=This field indicates whether or not a utility participant type is eligible for the liability product. Select this selection box if the utility participant type is eligible for this liability product.
Field.Label.InformationProvider=Information Provider
Field.Label.InformationProvider.Help=This field indicates whether or not an information provider participant type is eligible for the liability product. Select this selection box if the information provider participant type is eligible for this liability product.
Field.Label.ServiceSupplier=Service Supplier
Field.Label.ServiceSupplier.Help=This field indicates whether or not a service supplier participant type is eligible for the liability product. Select this selection box if the service supplier participant type is eligible for this liability product.
Field.Label.ProductProvider=Product Provider
Field.Label.ProductProvider.Help=This field indicates whether or not a product provider participant type is eligible for the liability product. Select this selection box if the product provider participant type is eligible for this liability product.

Cluster.Label.SecurityRestrictions=Security Restrictions
Field.Label.LocationSecurityLevel=Location Security Level
Field.Label.LocationSecurityLevel.Help=Location based case security can be activated at the product level by selecting the appropriate location type the users are restricted to. For example, you can select that users are restricted to modify case details governed by the liability product within the county location type. Thus, users can only modify case details for cases owned by users within their own county.
Field.Label.ApproveRights=Approve Rights
Field.Label.ApproveRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to approve cases governed by the liability product. By adding a security identifier to the Approve Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can approve or reject cases governed by that product. To add a security identifier to the Approve Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Approve Rights field, then only the case supervisor can approve or reject cases governed by that product.
Field.Label.CreateRights=Create Rights
Field.Label.CreateRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to create cases governed by the liability product. By adding a security identifier to the Create Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can create cases governed by that product. To add a security identifier to the Create Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Create Rights field, then any user can create cases for that product. Note that adding case evidence is considered a 'maintain' function. Thus, even if a user has security rights to create a case for a specific product, if security is in place for 'maintaining' cases for that same product, and the user does not have product security privileges to 'maintain', the user cannot enter evidence during case creation, nor check case eligibility. For information on 'maintain' product security, see the following Maintain Rights field.
Field.Label.MaintainRights=Maintain Rights
Field.Label.MaintainRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to maintain cases governed by the liability product. By adding a security identifier to the Maintain Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can maintain cases governed by that product. A user with 'maintain' rights can manage case evidence, manage case certification, and check case eligibility. To add a security identifier to the Maintain Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Maintain Rights field, then any user can maintain cases for that product.
Field.Label.ReadRights=Read Rights
Field.Label.ReadRights.Help=Option to restrict a user's ability to read (view) cases governed by the liability product. By adding a security identifier to the Read Rights field, only the users whose security roles contain the product security identifier can read (view) cases governed by that product. To add a security identifier to the Read Rights field, press the Search button. On the Product Security Identifiers pop-up window, click the Select link on the appropriate row from the list of security identifiers displayed. If no security identifier is added to the Read Access Rights field, then any user can read cases for that product.

Field.Label.ContractObjectType.Help=The type of contract object. A contract object in PSCD is defined as the equivalent of a financial case in the C\u00FAram system. Whenever a financial case of a certain type is created in C\u00FAram, a corresponding contract object of the matching type will be created in PSCD to process the ILIs generated for that case. In each ILI transferred from C\u00FAram to PSCD, the contract account number and the contract object number are presented which allows the ILI to be transferred to the corresponding FI-CA document.
