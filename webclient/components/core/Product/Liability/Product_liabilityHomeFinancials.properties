Field.Label.DateList=Date List
Field.Label.DateList.Help=In this field the assessment engine uses a date list to create case decisions. There are two types of date lists: the event date list and the pattern date list. Both of these date lists define the dates on which the assessment engine calls the rules engine. The event date list is a list of dates provided to the assessment engine; the pattern date list is a list compiled by the assessment engine. Products that use the event date list will require a list of dates on which the rules engine is called. Products that use the pattern date list will not require a list of dates, as the assessment engine compiles this date list automatically using the nominee delivery pattern and re-rate frequency.
