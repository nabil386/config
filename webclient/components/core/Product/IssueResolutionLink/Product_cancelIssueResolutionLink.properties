Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to remove an issue resolution from an issue. When an issue has been reviewed by a caseworker, the caseworker enters a resolution. The resolution reflects the caseworker's adjudication on the evidence to be used when determining the client's eligibility. For example, an "agree with client" resolution indicates that the evidence given by the client is to be used instead of the evidence provided by a third party.
