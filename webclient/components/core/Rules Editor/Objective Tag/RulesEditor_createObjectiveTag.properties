Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create an objective tag. An objective Tag is an amount of money (or a formula that evaluates an amount of money) for a specific objective. An objective tag is defined in terms of a specific period of time (from days to years), therefore an objective may have several objective tags. For example, an unemployment benefit product may have two objective tags, one for "per day" ($10) and one for "per week" ($70). If the objective to which the objective tag is added succeeds while executing rules, information about an objective tag is returned.
