Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a data item assignment. Data item assignments allow you to specify how to handle the data from the original rules data object. Intermediate calculations can be completed based on the data item of the rules data object. In order for the intermediate calculations to be performed, the rules data object must have a defined formula. The results of the intermediate calculations can be passed to the rules engine. A data item is actually an attribute of the rules data object that should be defined while creating the rule set.
