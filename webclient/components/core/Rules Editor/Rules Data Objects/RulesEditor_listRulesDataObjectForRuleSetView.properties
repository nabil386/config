Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of the rules data objects recorded in the system. To use a data item anywhere in a rule set you must assign a rules data object to contain the data item to the rule set. After an RDO is assigned to a rule set data item, that RDO can be used in data item conditions, function conditions, objective tags, and data item assignments in the rule set. RDOs assigned to a rule set also can be associated with rule list groups or objective list groups.
