Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of the work allocation simulations recorded in the system. Work Allocation Rule Sets are similar to Eligibility Rule Sets except that they define rules to determine how tasks are allocated. C\u00FAram provides the option to specify a task definition that allocates tasks according to the allocation strategy type specified as a work allocation rule set.
