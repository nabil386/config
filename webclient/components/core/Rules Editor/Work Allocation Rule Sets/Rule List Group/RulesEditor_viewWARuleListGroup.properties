Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a rule list group. A rule list group is essentially a rule group, but it is specifically used to execute the same rules a number of times. It does this for a set of similar data contained in the list rules data object of the rule list group. Rule list groups are defined based on the related list rules data object. There are some nesting constraints for rule list groups: a rule list group is allowed to nest in a sub rule set, rule group, objective group and objective. It is not allowed to nest in list groups.
