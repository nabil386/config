Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a reversal line item. A reversal line item is used to negate an original instruction line item. For example, if one of the financial line items of a liability financial transaction is issued to an employer incorrectly, you can reverse the financial transaction line item such that the employer is no longer liable for that amount.C\u00FAram also allows you to reverse a payment received from a participant. For example, if a check from an employer was recorded on the system but later the check bounced, you could then reverse the payment received.

ActionControl.Label.WriteOff=Write Off
ActionControl.Label.WriteOff.Help=You can press the Write Off button to write off a reversed line item. For example, if a payment received is recorded on the system and a portion of that payment received is allocated toward an outstanding liability financial line item, if that payment received were to be reversed, the participant would again be responsible for the liability instruction line item the payment received was allocated toward.
