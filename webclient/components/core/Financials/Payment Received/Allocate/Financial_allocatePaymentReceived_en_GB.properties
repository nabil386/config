Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to allocate a received payment. A payment received can be allocated toward any number of unprocessed liability instruction line items held by the person or employer from whom the payment was received. For example, if a person makes a payment of $100 to the organisation, that $100 can be allocated toward any number of outstanding liabilities for that person.
