Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create an un-applied deduction for a fixed amount. An un-applied deduction is a deduction that is deducted from a person's benefit payment to make a general refund to the organization. Un-applied deductions are used to recoup monies paid out by the organization. For example, an un-applied deduction can be created to recoup a one-off emergency payment to a participant. Un-applied deductions can be based on a fixed amount or a variable amount. A fixed amount is a set amount of money that is deducted from a person's benefit payment. A variable amount is a percentage amount that is deducted from a person's benefit payment.
