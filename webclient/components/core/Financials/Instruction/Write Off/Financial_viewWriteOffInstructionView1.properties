Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view write off instruction details. All or a portion of a liability can be written-off so that the case nominee is no longer responsible for the amount that has been written-off. For example, if a person who has a loan with the organization declares bankruptcy, you can write off each of the financial line items related to the loan. C\u00FAram also allows you to write off a reversed line item affiliated with a liability line item that had a payment received allocated toward it and then the payment received instruction was reversed. For example, if a payment received is recorded on the system and a portion of that payment received is allocated toward an outstanding liability financial line item, if that payment received were to be reversed, the participant would again be responsible for the liability instruction line item the payment received was allocated toward.
