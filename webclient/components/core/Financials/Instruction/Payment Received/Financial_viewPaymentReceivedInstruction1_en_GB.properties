Help.PageDescription=Payments can be received by the organisation from persons, employers, or unknown sources. When a payment is received, the system creates a payment received instrument, instruction, and instruction line item to reflect the information entered about the payment. The payment received instruction is added to the person or employer's list of financials. It can then be allocated toward a liability that the person or employer holds with the organisation.
