Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to enter a resolution on an investigation. An investigation cannot be resolved until a resolution is entered on it. When the investigation has been reviewed by a case worker, the case worker enters a resolution. The resolution reflects the case worker's adjudication on the evidence that is to be used when determining the client's eligibility. For example, an "agree with client" resolution indicates that the evidence given by the client is to be used instead of the evidence provided by a third party, e.g., an employer.
