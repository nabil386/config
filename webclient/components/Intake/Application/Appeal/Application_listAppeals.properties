Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of appeals recorded on the system. An appeal is a request to review one or more case, program, or issue decisions. In C\u00FAram, appeal cases are created to manage appeals on integrated cases, product delivery cases, prior appeal cases, and issues. All appeal cases have one or more appellants who initiate the appeal and a respondent who defends the original decision.
