Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a site map that lists the evidence categories for an application. Evidence is the data collected by an organization to facilitate the delivery of services to the organization's customers. Evidence is normally used by the rules to determine an outcome (payment, bill, etc.) or for reporting purposes. For example, in order to assess a person's eligibility for sickness benefit, you must record the date on which the person became sick and could no longer work. C\u00FAram provides an evidence list page for every application.
