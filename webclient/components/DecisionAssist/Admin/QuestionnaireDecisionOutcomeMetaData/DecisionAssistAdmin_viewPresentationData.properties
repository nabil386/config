Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view presentation data details. Presentation data dictates the information that is displayed beside questionnaires in a determination. The options for presentation data are "recommended", "mandatory", or "do not display". If, for example, "mandatory" is selected, the text, "mandatory", is displayed beside the questionnaire wherever listed for a determination. Note that presentation data is for information purposes only: it does not enforce a questionnaire to be completed.
