Help.PageDescription=This page allows the user to remove all the ICD Codes in a version. The remove action is different depending on the ICD Code version status. If the version has In Edit status, Remove action physically deletes all the ICD Codes in the version. The corresponding ICD Code Version record is also physically deleted. If the version is in Released status, Remove sets the End Dates on all the ICD Codes belonging to the selected version, provided none of the ICD Codes in the version has condition associations effective in that date range. This Remove action will also set the same end date on the To date field for that Version. If any ICD Codes belonging to this version already have an End Date which is later than the remove date being set in this page, the ICD Code End Dates are also set to the same version remove date.
