Help.PageDescription=This page allows the user to release an ICD Code version that has been uploaded. Releasing an ICD Codes version will activate the version and make it available for use in the system. Prior to release, ICD Codes in that version cannot be associated with Conditions. This ensures that all ICD Codes in a version are made available at the same time. Release will set the From date for a Version, and also automatically sets the Start Date for all ICD Code records in a version to the release date, i.e. From date for a particular version is equal to the Start Date for each ICD Code record in that version. It does not change the existing Condition ICD Associations for the previous version.
