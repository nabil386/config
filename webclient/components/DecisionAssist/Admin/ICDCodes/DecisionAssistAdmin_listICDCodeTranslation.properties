Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of ICD code translations. Medical conditions can have one or more ICD codes which are the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases. These associations ensure that medical conditions are assessed consistently and based on a recognized standard. Localization support is provided for ICD codes. For example, a letter sent to a person being assessed for a particular medical condition can be written in that person's preferred language.
