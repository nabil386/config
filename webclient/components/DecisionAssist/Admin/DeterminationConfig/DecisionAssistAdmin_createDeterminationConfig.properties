Field.Label.StandAlone.Help=This indicator is to decide whether an assessment configuration needs to be created for the determination being configured. On setting this indicator to Yes it implies that an assessment can be run for that determination only. Once set the standalone indicator cannot be changed. If this indicator is set in error the Determination Configuration must be deleted. The home page identifier for the Assessment Configuration depends on  whether certain indicators other than the StandaloneInd are set in the Determination Configuration. The indicators are checked in the following order: Support CoC Processing Ind is checked first as this determines whether there will be a View at the Assessment level only or both at the Assessment and Determination Level. Then multi source Ind is checked as this determines which views of Determination/Assessment are appropriate. Then auto consolidation which can only be set if Multi Source is set.
