Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a questionnaire. Questionnaires are configured using the C\u00FAram IEG editor. By using C\u00FAram IEG, answers can be retrieved in an 'intelligent' manner. Each question in the questionnaire belongs to a question group; each question group belongs to a question page. Certain question pages can have preconditions. For example, if a person answers yes to the three questions in Group 1, then that person is labeled as a serious delinquent and no other questions need be asked of that person; there is enough information to make a decision.
