Help.PageDescription=A typical picture is a set of answers that a client is most likely to give to the questions posed under certain situations. For example a needs questionnaire may have a different typical picture for a male suffering from severe asthma to a female suffering from severe asthma. The decision matrix and outcome are used to define the particular circumstances under which the typical picture is used. If one of the fields is defined, then a value must be selected for the other. If neither of these fields is specified, then the typical picture created is considered the default typical picture for the questionnaire. There can only be one typical picture per questionnaire that does not have a decision
