Help.PageDescription=This page allows the user to release a new version of the questionnaire. This means that the questionnaire can then be used in a decision matrix for any determination package to which it has been added. When a new version is released, the from date of the new version is set to the current business date and time and the to date on the previous version if one exists, is also set to this date and time. However if a to date is already held on the previous version then the to date of that previous version does not change.
