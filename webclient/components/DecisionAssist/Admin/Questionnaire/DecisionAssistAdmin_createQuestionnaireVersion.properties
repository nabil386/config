Help.PageDescription=This page allows the user to create a new version of a questionnaire based on the latest released version of the questionnaire. The system checks if the questionnaire is part of a Determination Package and if there is a previously released version of that determination package which includes the questionnaire. If these conditions are satisfied it means that the questionnaire may be used on an assessment.
