Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a new version of a typical picture. Typical pictures are used to compare typical answers for a questionnaire to actual answers for a given outcome from a previous determination within the same assessment. A user can clone an existing typical picture version and make changes to it, rather than having to re-create a similar version from scratch. Version support is also provided for determination packages, questionnaires, and decision matrices.
