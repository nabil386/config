ActionControl.Label.Yes.Help=Removing a decision matrix version deletes  (physical) the association between the decision matrix  version and the latest version of the determination package. Therefore determination package version must be In Edit in order for this to happen. If the decision matrix version is not associated with any other version of the determination package then it should also be deleted. However, if it is associated with another version of the determination package  then the To Date of the latest released version of the decision matrix must be set to the current business date. This means that the decision matrix version will be no longer be used with that particular version of the determination package. If the decision matrix version is deleted, the outcome association link records  and the corresponding score associations should also be deleted.
