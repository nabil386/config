Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to consolidate answers from third parties with the answers from the questionnaire. To make a decision, determination-based assessments may require input from third parties. For example, medical assessments often require answers from a doctor. Rather than using the C\u00FAram IEG execution widget to complete an entire third party questionnaire, third party requests can be designed to include only those questions which are relevant to the third party. Third party answers must be consolidated with all other answers to the same questions. Consolidation can either occur automatically, where the latest answers replace previous ones, or manually, where the system user selects the most appropriate answer.
