Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to clone a determination-based assessment. A determination-based assessment can be cloned at any stage in its lifecycle. Note, however, the determination configuration associated with the determination-based assessment must be active in order for a clone to be created. This is because the cloning functionality reads the determination configuration administration components. All decisions, questions, answers, third party requests, primary client details, and determinations are cloned.
