Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a third party request. To make a decision, determination-based assessments may require input from third parties. For example, medical assessments often require answers from a doctor. Rather than using the C\u00FAram IEG execution widget to complete an entire third party questionnaire, third party requests can be designed to include only those questions which are relevant to the third party. When first recorded in the system, a third party request has a not sent status. It is possible to manually change the status to sent; however, there is no formal processing to send the third party request since the system is not aware of where the request should be sent to or how best to send it. Answers to third party requests are instead manually recorded on the system.
