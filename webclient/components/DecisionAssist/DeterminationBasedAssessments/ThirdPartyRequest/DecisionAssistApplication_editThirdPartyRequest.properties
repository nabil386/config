Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify a third party request. To make a decision, determination-based assessments may require input from third parties. For example, medical assessments often require answers from a doctor. Rather than using the C\u00FAram IEG execution widget to complete an entire third party questionnaire, third party requests can be designed to include only those questions which are relevant to the third party.
