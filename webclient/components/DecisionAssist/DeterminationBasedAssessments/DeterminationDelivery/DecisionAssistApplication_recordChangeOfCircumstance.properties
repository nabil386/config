Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to record a change in circumstance for a determination-based assessment. Change in circumstance processing allows for a new determination to be created from the completed determination. This new determination must have an effective date which represents the effect period for the new determination. Change in circumstance processing is important in situations where it is necessary to monitor a client's circumstances over time. For example, it is important to monitor a client's risk of abuse or neglect over time to ensure that the risk does not progress from low to medium or high.
