Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to cancel a determination. Typically determination-based assessments are canceled when created in error or when an error is introduced. It is not possible to cancel a completed determination-based assessment. When canceling a determination-based assessment, all its decisions are also canceled. The assessment still appears in the list of assessments at the integrated case level or is accessible as a stand-alone assessment. This is to allow the assessment to be cloned, if necessary.
