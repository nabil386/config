Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view and manage the evidence dashboard groups associated with this case type. You can expand the dashboard group in the list to view the evidence types that have been added to the dashboard group. The user can set required evidence for a particular dashboard group. Evidence types which are flagged as required are used to prompt the caseworker that the evidence type should be entered as part of the task this evidence group relates to. No validation will be thrown if a required evidence type is not recorded for an evidence group. Once a dashboard group configuration is created it can be selected on the evidence dashboard.
