#  Notes History Properties
#  ---------------
#
#  Property resource for all localisable
#  attributes of the Notes History Renderer.

#  The "order.on" entry in this properties file contains the order in which the statement "{author} {on} {date}" needs to be written.
#  (e.g.)

#  The first parameter, {0} represents the author (username) of a Note. 
#  (the value for this first parameter is filled in the Java code)
#  The second parameter, {1} represents the localised word "on", which comes from the the "text.on" entry in this properties file.
#  The third parameter, {2} represents the date on which a Note was written.
#  (the value for this third parameter is filled in the Java code)
#
# The "text.on" entry in this properties file contains the localised value of the English word "on".
