Changes
=======================================
CK Editor SPM Version: ckeditor_4.5.10_curam_1.1
Date: September-2022
SPM Release:   SPM 8.0.3.0 and other releases
SPM Ticket:    SPM-125157  - Rich Text Editor removes highlighted text in the middle of a sentence without a warning message
Files Changed:
 - ckeditor/plugins/pastefromword/filter/default.js - replaced with new version.
 - ckeditor/plugins/whitelist/plugin.js             - modified.
Rationale for Changes:
The default.js file has been replaced with the version from the CK Editor 4.6.2 version to solve the issue outlined in
JIRA Ticket SPM-12515 in which the Rich Text Editor was removing highlighted text in the middle of a sentence without a warning message.
The plugin.js file has been modified to add the "lang" attribute to the CKEDITOR.config.whitelist_globalAttributes because the
new pasteFromWord update generates that attribute. Without this change the user would be warned on not extsting format changes on every paste.

=======================================
CK Editor SPM Version: ckeditor_4.5.10_curam_1.0
Date: May-2017
SPM Release:   SPM 7.0.1.0
SPM Ticket:    RTC-183356 - Format Warning" message is being thrown - relating to updates to the Intake Narrative
Files Changed:
 - cefwidgets/ckeditor/plugins/whitelist/plugin.js
Rationale for Changes:
At the moment, when content is added to the Rich text Editor (RTE), the content is checked against a whitelist and when something is
removed an error is thrown. This error is thrown when information is added to the RTE and if information is loaded into the RTE as a
result of a read from the database. In the case of an Intake. We need to update the RTE check to differentiate when information is being
added to the RTE for the first time and when information is being read from a database (loaded). The formatting error should only be thrown
when information is added to the RTE. Implemented and onPaste event in the whitelist plugin to format the 'pasted' data. If anything was
removed during formatting an error is thrown.

=======================================
CK Editor SPM Version: ckeditor_4.5.10_curam_1.0
Date: May-2016
SPM Release:   SPM 6.0.5.2 iFix5
SPM Ticket:    RTC-149431 - Modal becomes all white when using Spell Checker and browser used is Microsoft IE
Files Changed:
 - ckeditor\plugins\ibmspellchecker\dialogs\ibmspellchecker.js
Rationale for Changes:
The check function has been altered to remove misspellings which were incorrectly returned from the service call.
E.g.: If "minister's" is passed to the service, "'s" is returned. The word "'s" does not exist in the original text so this
miss spelling now ignored. MS Word's smart quotes have been added to the regex pattern in the moveToNextWord function.
This allows the pattern to identify the last letter of a word surrounded by MS Word's smart quotes.
