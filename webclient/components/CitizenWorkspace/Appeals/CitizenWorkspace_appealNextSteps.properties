confirmation.cluster.text=We will also send you a letter letting you know that we received your appeal request. This notice will also provide you with an explanation of your health coverage while your appeal is pending. If there's a problem with your appeal request, like if it's missing information or we need clarification, we will inform you and permit you to correct the issue within a specific timeframe. 

review.cluster.title=2. Review of your information
review.cluster.text=We will review your appeal request and any additional information you submit, along with the information we used to originally determine your eligibility. We may contact you to request additional information or to discuss your appeal. You have the right to review the information being used to resolve your appeal, including the information in your electronic account. 

informalres.cluster.title=3. Informal resolution
informalres.cluster.text=We may be able to resolve your appeal informally, by reviewing all of your information and discussing it with you. After reviewing all your information and discussing your appeal with you, as necessary, we will send you an informal resolution decision that explains your eligibility for health coverage. If you're satisfied with this informal resolution decision, we will implement the decision and close your appeal. In this case, you wouldn't have a hearing.

hearing.cluster.title=4. Hearing
hearing.cluster.text=If you disagree with the informal resolution decision, you can continue your appeal at a hearing. A hearing is a formal meeting involving you and a hearing officer where you can explain why you think we made a mistake with your eligibility determination. Your hearing may take place over the phone. You can participate in the hearing by yourself or have someone participate in your hearing with you. This person can be a friend, relative, lawyer, your authorized representative (if you have one), or another individual. You have the right to provide additional information to the hearing officer for consideration before or at the time of the hearing. You also have the right to review all the information that the hearing officer will be considering for your appeal, including any information in your organization account. After the hearing, the hearing officer will review all your information and make a final decision about your appeal, which will be mailed to you. If you mail it separately, include the complete contact information of appellant 1 (as it appears on this form), including name, date of birth, phone number, email address (optional), and address. If there are multiple appellants listed on this form, identify the specific appellant(s) whose appeal(s) the additional information supports.
