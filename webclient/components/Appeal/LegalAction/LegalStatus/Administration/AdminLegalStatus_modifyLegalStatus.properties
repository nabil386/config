Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify legal status details. The ability to configure and define legal statuses for legal actions is supported. When a court makes a decision about what will happen to a participant, it determines a legal status. Examples of legal statuses include adjudicated, crown ward, parental rights terminated, parental custody, and temporary custody. During the course of a case or legal action, a participant's legal status may change. The changes in a participant's legal status can be accessed and tracked by a case worker.
