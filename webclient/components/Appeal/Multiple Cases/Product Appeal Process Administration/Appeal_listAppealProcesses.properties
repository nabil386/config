Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of appeals processes for a product. Most organizations have an appeal process which may or may not use all three appeal types provided by C\u00FAram. The type of appeal that can be held at a particular level is determined by the organization and is configured at the product level. For example, the organization may set a hearing appeal as the first level of appeal with the judicial review case as the second level of appeal. It can also designate any type of appeal to be held at an appeal level. From this page, you can view appeal process details and create a new appeals process.
