An appeal process consists of valid appeal types and stages of appeal that can be held for a product. Valid appeal types and stages of appeal for a product are determined by the organization.  For example, the organization may set the appeals configuration on a product so that there are two and not three appeal stages. It may set a hearing review case as the first level of appeal with the judicial review case as the second level of appeal.
