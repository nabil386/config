Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify appeal security configuration settings. These settings apply to all appeal cases. When a user attempts to access appeal information or perform operations on an appeal case, the system checks the user's security to ensure that he or she has the appropriate rights. In order to perform appeal operations, your security role must include the appropriate security identifiers or SIDS. These SIDS are applied to one or more rights. You can perform appeal operations if your user profile contains the SID associated with the particular appeal right. For example, in order to approve an appeal case, your profile must have the SID assigned to the appeal approve rights.
