Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to manage a judicial review decision. When the judicial review has been held, a judicial review decision is entered by the judicial review case owner and a decision document or documents attached to the judicial review. Unlike the decisions for other types of appeals the decision for the judicial review is automatically approved. Before the judicial review case decision is entered, the judicial review case owner must enter a decision or resolution for each related case considered at the judicial review. The overall judicial review decision is deduced from these resolutions.
