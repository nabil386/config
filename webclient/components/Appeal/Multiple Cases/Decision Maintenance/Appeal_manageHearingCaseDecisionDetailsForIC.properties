Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to manage a hearing case decision. A hearing case decision marks whether the appeal has been accepted or rejected. For appeals with multiple decisions, the hearing case decision indicates whether or not a resolution has been successfully entered for each of these decisions. Once a hearing is completed, a resolution or multiple resolutions can be entered based on that hearing. A decision document can be attached to the hearing case to document the issues considered at the hearing and the resolutions reached for each issue. The hearing official enters an overall hearing case decision based on each decision resolution. This starts the hearing case decision lifecycle. The hearing case decision must be approved or rejected. The approval of a hearing case decision verifies that the hearing resolutions are to be implemented. The rejection of a hearing case decision indicates that the original case decision is upheld.

Field.Label.DecisionStatus=Status
Field.Label.DecisionStatus.Help=The appeal decision status reflects the current decision processing. When no decision exists on the hearing case, the decision status is "not decided". When a decision is first entered on the system, the decision status is "in progress". Once the decision details are finalized, the decision is submitted for approval thus changing the status to "submitted". If the decision is approved, the status is "approved"; if the decision is "rejected", the status is "rejected".
