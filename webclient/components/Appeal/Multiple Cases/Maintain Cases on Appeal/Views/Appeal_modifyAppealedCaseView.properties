Field.Label.ContinueBenefits.Help=This field indicates whether or not the appellant is to receive payments during the appeal process. If the status of the continue benefits indicator is 'On' then the appellant is requesting that their benefit payments continue while the appeal is progressing. If the continue benefits indicator is set to 'Off', this means the appellant wishes to have their benefit payments stopped while the appeal is progressing. In this scenario, the case owner is notified so they can take the appropriate action on the case. Note that the process of suspending the payments must be performed manually by the user.
