Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to acknowledge the receipt of multiple appeal requests for an appeal case. When an appeal request is received by the organization, a receipt notice acknowledging that the single appeal request has been received is sent to the appellant. You can create this notice when you add the appeal request to the appeal. In this case, only that single appeal request is acknowledged on the receipt notice regardless of whether there are other appeal requests for the same appeal. If there are multiple appeal requests for the same appeal case, you can acknowledge all of these in a single receipt notice. Only appeal requests whose acknowledgment is outstanding for the appeal case are included on the receipt notice.
