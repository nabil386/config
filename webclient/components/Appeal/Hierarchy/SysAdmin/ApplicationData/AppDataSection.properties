page.title.codetbls=Code Tables
page.title.codetbls.Help=Code tables contain codes for items that appear in C\u00FAram drop-down fields. Code tables are used to save space in the C\u00FAram database; by storing drop-down field selections as codes rather than the full text of the selection, a great deal of space can be saved in the database. For example, rather than storing the ethnicity "American Indian or Alaskan Native" in the database, the application can store the code "ETH4".

XSL style sheets are used to format the XML data for printing.
