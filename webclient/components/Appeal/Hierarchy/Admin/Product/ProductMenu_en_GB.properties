page.title.deliverymethods=Delivery Methods
page.title.deliverymethods.Help=A delivery method is a method by which financial transactions can be issued or received for a product. Delivery methods can apply to benefit products only, to liability products only, or to both. For example, the invoice delivery method would only apply to liability products. Each delivery method can have an offset. This refers to the number of days prior to the due date which a financial component needs to be processed to ensure that the benefit or liability reaches the participant on time. For example, the delivery methods for benefits include cash, check, EFT, and vouchers. The check delivery method has an offset of three days in advance to allow for bank clearing. This offset ensures that funds are available to the participant on the due date.
