Field.Label.Resolution.Help=Appealed case resolution from the drop-down list of resolutions. An accepted resolution indicates that the appeal has been accepted and the appropriate action must be taken on the original case. A remanded resolution indicates that the appeal is being reviewed by the organization for reconsideration. A rejected resolution indicates that the appeal has been rejected and the decision on the lead case is to remain. It is up to the appropriate system user, i.e. the caseworker of the original case, to implement the decision resolution. For remanded decisions, the system automatically issues a task to the appeal case owner and the original case owner informing them that a new appeal case must be created to review the remanded appeal.
