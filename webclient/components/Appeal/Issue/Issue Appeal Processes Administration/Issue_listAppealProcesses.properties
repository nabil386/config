Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of appeal processes for an issue. An appeal process consists of valid appeal types and stages of appeal that can be held for an issue. Valid appeal types and stages of appeal for an issue are determined by the organization.  For example, the organization may set the appeals configuration on an issue so that there are two and not three appeal stages. It may set a hearing review case as the first level of appeal with the judicial review case as the second level of appeal.
