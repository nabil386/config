Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of appellants on the appealed issue case. An appellant is a party who appeals a decision or judgment. An appellant is usually the primary client of a case who disagrees with a decision made by the organization. For example, a person may appeal a decision where he or she is determined ineligible for unemployment benefit. An appeal case can have one or more appellants. For example, a number of people may have the same issue with their employer. The organization may wish to consider a number of issues from a number of different participants at the one hearing. To reflect this situation, a hearing official can add multiple appellants to an appeal case. Each appellant that is added to an existing appeal case will have their case decision considered at the hearing held for the appeal case.
