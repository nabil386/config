Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view a list of Appeal Case types. There are three appeal case types: hearing case, hearing review, and judicial review. Each appeal type has a different purpose. The purpose of a hearing case is to manage hearings held to appeal a decision on a case, issue, prior appeal, or a combination of case and issue decisions. Like a hearing case, a hearing review is an appeal to overturn a decision on a case, issue, or prior appeal. A judicial review is an appeal that is conducted by a court to overturn a decision on a case, issue, or prior appeal. If a decision is appealed to a judicial review, it is within the court's jurisdiction to overturn it.
