Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to create a judicial review decision. Judicial review decision processing differs from hearing case and hearing appeals decision processing in that judicial review decisions are outside the control of the organization. Thus, any decision made on a judicial review outside the organization is recorded on the system by the judicial review case owner.

Field.Label.Resolution.Help=Judicial review resolution from the drop-down list of resolutions. An accepted resolution indicates that the appeal has been accepted and the appropriate action must be taken on the lead case. A remanded resolution indicates that the appeal is being reviewed by the organization for reconsideration. A rejected resolution indicates that the appeal has been rejected and the decision on the lead case is to remain. It is up to the appropriate user, i.e. caseworker of the original case, to implement the decision resolution. For remanded decisions, the system issues a task to the judicial review case owner and the original case owner informing them that a hearing case must be created to review the remanded appeal.
