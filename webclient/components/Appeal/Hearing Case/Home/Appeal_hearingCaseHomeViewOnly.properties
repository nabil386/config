Field.Label.Resolution.Help=Hearing resolution for a decision, i.e. "not decided", "accepted", "rejected", or "remanded". For hearing cases with no decision, the resolution is "not decided".

A "rejected" resolution indicates that the appeal has been rejected and the decision on the lead case is to remain. Note, however, the resolution on a hearing case does not affect the system processing. It is up to the appropriate system user, i.e. the case worker of the lead case, to act upon the decision resolution.
