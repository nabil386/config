Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to reopen a hearing case. A closed hearing case can be reopened if the attendance for the completed hearing on the hearing case is insufficient. The hearing attendance is considered insufficient when the appellant or respondent is not present at the hearing. If product security is set up on the lead case whose decision is being appealed, you must have the product security privileges to "approve" and/or "create". When you reopen the hearing case, if you have case supervisor privileges, the system automatically approves the hearing case. If you do not have case supervisor privileges, the system issues a task to the hearing case supervisor informing the supervisor to approve or reject the hearing case.
