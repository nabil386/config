Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view appellant details. An appellant is a party who appeals a decision or judgment. An appellant is usually the primary client of a case who disagrees with a decision made by the organization. For example, a person may appeal a decision where he or she is determined ineligible for unemployment benefit. An appeal case can have one or more appellants. For example, a number of people may have the same issue with their employer. The organization may wish to consider a number of issues from a number of different participants at the one hearing. To reflect this situation, a hearing official can add multiple appellants to an appeal case.
