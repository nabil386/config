Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to continue a hearing. A continuance is the postponement of a hearing to a later fixed date. The organization has the option to continue a scheduled hearing if one of the case participants is unable to attend the hearing. For example, you can continue a hearing if the appellant requests to continue the hearing due to illness. To continue a hearing, you must be assigned to the hearing scheduler job. The user responsible for continuing the hearing is usually the hearing scheduler.
