Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify a hearing attendee record for a user attendee. The attendance for a user attendee cannot be modified unless the hearing has actually been held. Otherwise the attendance is not known. The modification of attendance is not restricted by the status of the appeal case. Therefore even if the appeal case has been closed or canceled the attendance can be modified as long as the hearing has been held.
