Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to invite a user attendee to a hearing. Home, phone, and location hearings require that relevant user attendees are invited to the hearing. Each user's attendance can be updated once the hearing is held. Additionally, users can be removed from the attendance list which effectively un-invites them from the hearing.
