Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to continue a hearing for a hearing review. A continuance is the postponement of a hearing to a later fixed date. The organization has the option to continue a scheduled review hearing if one of the case participants is unable to attend the review hearing. For example, you can continue a review hearing if a representative requests a continuance due to a previous engagement. To continue a review hearing, you must be assigned to the hearing scheduler job. The user responsible for continuing the review hearing is usually the review scheduler.
