Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to invite a hearing reviewer to the hearing held for the hearing review appeal. A user can be invited to attend an appeal hearing. This is used, for example, to invite the original caseworker to attend the hearing and give evidence. Once the relevant user attendees are invited to the hearing, each user's attendance can be updated once the hearing is held. Additionally, users can be removed from the attendance list which effectively un-invites the user from the hearing.
