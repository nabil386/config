Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify third party details. A third party is a participant, other than the appellant(s) and respondent that is involved with a hearing case appeal. For example, an employer can be recorded as a third party on an appeal if the organization decides that the primary client is ineligible based on a discrepancy between the evidence given by the primary client and the evidence provided by his or her employer. If the primary client appeals the decision, the primary client is recorded as the appellant on the appeal, the organization is recorded as the respondent, and the employer is recorded as the third party.
