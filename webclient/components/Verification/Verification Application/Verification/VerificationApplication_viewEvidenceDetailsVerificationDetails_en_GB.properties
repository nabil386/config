Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to view verification details. Verification is the process of checking the accuracy of the information given by clients seeking services from a social enterprise organisation. The verification of client information, such as evidence, can take a number of forms; it can be provided by documents, e.g., birth certificates or bank statements, or by verbal means, e.g., telephone calls. Some examples of evidence verifications that might be required by a social enterprise organisation are, an original copy of a birth certificate, a fax from a doctor's certifying a person's inability to work, a telephone call from a parole officer certifying that someone has met his or her parole obligations.
