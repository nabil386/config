Help.PageDescription=This page lists the verification requirements that have been recorded on the system. A verification requirement defines rules governing the verification requirement for a piece of data. A piece of data, e.g., date of birth, may have different verification requirements depending on the case for which the data has been captured or used. For example, a date of birth captured at the integrated case level may have a particular verification requirement for the integrated case, however it may also have different verification requirements for the product delivery cases that have been added to the integrated case.
