Help.PageDescription=This page lists the dependent data items that have been recorded on the system. Dependent data items are specific pieces of evidence that have a direct influence on the verification of a related data item. Although these pieces of evidence do not require verification, it may be important to record them for evidence that does require verification. For example, if the organisation wishes to verify the reason that a household member was absent from the household, the length of the absence may be an important fact to record for the verification.
