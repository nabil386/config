Help.PageDescription=This page allows you to modify dependent data item details. Dependent data items are specific pieces of evidence that have a direct influence on the verification of a related data item. Although these pieces of evidence do not require verification, it may be important to record them for evidence that does require verification. For example, if the organization wishes to verify the reason that a household member was absent from the household, the length of the absence may be an important fact to record for the verification.
