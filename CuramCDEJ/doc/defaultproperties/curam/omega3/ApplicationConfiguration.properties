#
# Tab session data is updated on the client tier each time a tab is opened,
# closed or modified in the browser. This data is written to the database to
# maintain it across J2EE sessions. To reduce the number of database writes
# caused by these updates, the frequency of the writes can be controlled by a
# combination of two factors.
#
# The update count threshold specifies the number of tab session data updates
# that must be received before the data is written. Once the threshold is
# reached, the recent updates are written and counting starts again from zero
# until the threshold is reached. A value of one causes writes on every update.
# A value of zero (or a negative or invalid value) disables writing based on
# update counts.
#
# The update period threshold specifies the number of seconds that must have
# elapsed since the last write to the database before a new update will trigger
# another write. A value of zero (or a negative or invalid value) disables
# writing based on update periods.
#
# If both values are set to zero, tab session data is never written to the
# database. If the update count threshold is one, the update period threshold
# is ignored, as writes will happen on every update. If the update count
# threshold is not reached, but the update period threshold has been reached,
# a write will occur, and vice versa.
#
# Tab session data is written to the database when the user logs out,
# regardless of the value of the current update count or last write time.
# However, if both configuration values are zero, the data will not be written
# on logout. This can be a useful configuration in a test environment where
# multiple testers are logged into the same account. Preventing database writes
# will avoid side-effects between the testers' tab sessions.
#
# By default, every tenth update, or any update two or more minutes (120s)
# after the last write, will trigger a new write to the database.
#
tabSessionUpdateCountThreshold=10
tabSessionUpdatePeriodThreshold=120

# The Dynamic UIM system requires information about the application model to
# validate UIM pages at run-time. This model information can be initialized
# when the client application starts or when it is first required for a Dynamic
# UIM page. As the initialization process requires a significant amount of
# memory to execute for large application models, it is preferable to perform
# it on start-up, so that it does not affect a running application. Therefore,
# this property enables this early model initialization by default.
#
# Set the value to "false" to cause the model to be initialized when it is
# first required by a Dynamic UIM page. This is a suitable setting for a
# development environment, as the developer may not want to access Dynamic UIM
# pages and may not want to wait for the initialization to complete each time
# the application is started. Any value other than "false" will be treated as
# if it were "true".
# 
# If this property is not specified, the value "true" will be assumed and the
# model initialization will be performed on starting the application.
