</UL>

<P>The declared rule attribute may or may not override an identically-named rule attribute declared on an ancestor {@curam.entity creole.database.CREOLERuleClass Rule Class}.</P>

<entity name="PrecedentChangeItem"><![CDATA[@curam.logicalname Precedent Change Item

@curam.definition  An item in a {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Set}, i.e. details of a precedent which has changed (identified by its type and ID).

@curam.description

<P>When a client of the Dependency Manager identifies that data that may have been used in a calculation has changed, then that client can request that the Dependency Manager must identify and recalculate dependent values affected by the change.<P>

<P>If the Dependency Manager is configured to defer the identification/recalculation work to another transaction (e.g. by enqueuing a deferred process request or by waiting until the Dependency Manager batch suite is next run), then the Dependency Manager must record the changed precedent data in a {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Set}.  Each item of changed precedent data is stored as a row on this entity, linking to its owning {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Set}.</P>

@curam.example
<P>The Eligibility and Entitlement Engine identifies that a determination result for {@curam.entity core.ProductDelivery Product Delivery} 123 depends on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>data from the claimant's row on the {@curam.entity core.Person Person} entity;</LI>
<LI>active evidence from the parent integrated case 122; and</LI>
<LI>product configuration data stored on {@curam.entity core.sl.infrastructure.assessment.CREOLEProduct CREOLE Product}.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Later, change of circumstances evidence is activated on integrated case 122, and the Eligibility and Entitlement Engine notifies the Dependency Manager that there has been a change to the precedent data of type "active evidence" for case 122.  The Dependency Manager:</P>
<UL>
<LI>stores a new {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Set} row;</LI>
<LI>stores a new row on this entity identifying the data that changed and ties to the precedent change set row stored above; and</LI>
<LI>submits the precedent change set for deferred processing.</LI>
</UL>

<P>When the deferred processing request is later dequeued, the Dependency Manager uses the precedent change item stored in the precedent change set together with the {@curam.entity dependency.Dependency Dependency} rows to identify that {@curam.entity core.ProductDelivery Product Delivery} 123 must be reassessed.</P>

@curam.technotes

<P>The data on this table may only be read or written using Dependency Manager APIs - no direct access to the underlying data is supported.  DMX files and/or database scripts must not be used to populate this entity.</P>
<P>Optimistic locking is not required as rows are never modified.</P>

<P>The Dependency Manager has no inherent understanding of the precedent referred to by a row on this entity.  As such the precedentType and precedentID attributes on this entity are not constrained by foreign keys, since the Dependency Manager intentionally does not maintain any lists of known precedents in the system.</P>

@curam.definition  Controls the currently-open and submitted {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Sets} for batch processing.

@curam.description

<P>When a client of the Dependency Manager identifies that data that may have been used in a calculation has changed, then that client can request that the Dependency Manager must identify and recalculate dependent values affected by the change.<P>

<P>If the Dependency Manager is configured to defer the identification/recalculation work to the next run of the Dependency Manager batch suite, then the Dependency Manager stores new {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeItem Precedent Change Items} in the currently-open {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Set} for batch processing.  This {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Set} is identified by the row on this entity which has the key value for the "Open" status.</P>


<P>When the Dependency Manager batch suite starts, then:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the currently-open batch {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Set} becomes submitted, and the "Submitted" row on this entity is updated to point to it; and</LI>
<LI>a new open batch {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Set} is stored, and the "Open" row on this entity is updated to point to it.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The dependent identification phase of the Dependency Manager batch suite can now identify the submitted batch {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Set} by retrieving the "Submitted" row from this entity.</P>

<P>When the Dependency Manager batch suite completes, the submitted  {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Set}  transitions to "Complete", and the "Submitted" row on this entity is updated so that it no longer points to any {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSet Precedent Change Set}.</P>

@curam.definition A set of changes to precedent data.

@curam.description

<P>When a client of the Dependency Manager identifies that data that may have been used in a calculation has changed, then that client can request that the Dependency Manager must identify and recalculate dependent values affected by the change.<P>

<P>If the Dependency Manager is configured to defer the identification/recalculation work to another transaction (e.g. by enqueuing a deferred process request or by waiting until the Dependency Manager batch suite is next run), then the Dependency Manager must record the changed precedent data in a precedent change set.  Each precedent change set has a header record stored as a row on this entity.</P>

<P>By default, most rows on this entity relate to precedent change sets which are processed in deferred processing.  However, at all times there is a single open precedent change set which records precedent change items to be processed in batch, as identified by the "open" record on the {@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeSetBatchCtrl Precedent Change Set Batch Control} entity.</P>

<P>Each precedent change set goes through this lifecycle as stored in the status attribute:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Open. The state of a precedent change set when it is initially created. In
this state new precedent change items can be added to the precedent
change set.</LI>
<LI>Submitted. The precedent change set has been submitted into dependent-identfication processing. No more precedent change items can be added to the precedent change set.</LI>
<LI>Complete. The recalculation of all dependents affected by the precedent
changes has been completed. The precedent change set is kept for historical purposes only.</LI>
</UL>


@curam.example
<P>The Eligibility and Entitlement Engine identifies that a determination result for {@curam.entity core.ProductDelivery Product Delivery} 123 depends on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>data from the claimant's row on the {@curam.entity core.Person Person} entity;</LI>
<LI>active evidence from the parent integrated case 122; and</LI>
<LI>product configuration data stored on {@curam.entity core.sl.infrastructure.assessment.CREOLEProduct CREOLE Product}.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Later, change of circumstances evidence is activated on integrated case 122, and the Eligibility and Entitlement Engine notifies the Dependency Manager that there has been a change to the precedent data of type "active evidence" for case 122.  The Dependency Manager:</P>
<UL>
<LI>stores a new row on this entity to open a new precedent change set;</LI>
<LI>stores a 
{@curam.entity dependency.PrecedentChangeItem Precedent Change Item} identifying the data that changed and  ties to the precedent change set row on this entity; and</LI>
<LI>submits the precedent change set for deferred processing by enqueuing a deferred processing request and transitioning the status on the precedent change set from "Open" to "Submitted".</LI>
</UL>

<P>When the deferred processing request is later dequeued, the Dependency Manager uses the information in the precedent change set together with the {@curam.entity dependency.Dependency Dependency} rows to identify that {@curam.entity core.ProductDelivery Product Delivery} 123 must be reassessed.  After triggering reassessment for the case, the Dependency Manager closes the precedent change set by transitioning the status on the row from "Submitted" to "Closed".</P>

<P>The data on this table may only be read or written using Dependency Manager APIs - no direct access to the underlying data is supported.  Custom DMX files and/or database scripts must not be used to populate this entity.  The DMX file for this entity included with the application MUST be used to create a row for the initial precedent change set required by the application.</P>

<P>It is perfectly possible for the Dependency Manager to be notified of changes in data, where that data has never been used in any calculation, and thus the data is not identified as a precedent in any {@curam.entity dependency.Dependency Dependency} row.  In such circumstances the Dependency Manager will identify that no dependents are affected by the changes in data.</P>
