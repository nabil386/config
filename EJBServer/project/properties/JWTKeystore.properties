# If location is left empty, a new keystore with a self-signed cert will be generated and used.
# If an existing keystore is to be used, the following 5 properties must be updated to match.
jwt.keystore.filename=jwtkeystore.p12
jwt.keystore.location=
jwt.keystore.password=password
jwt.keystore.type=PKCS12
# The alias name for the private key used for signing the JWT
jwt.key.alias=jwtkeyalias


# CERTIFICATE PROPERTIES
# These are used to create a self-signed cert, if using the default generated keystore, at build time.
# These properties are not required if using an existing keystore with existing certificate.
jwt.cert.common.name=JWT
jwt.cert.organisation.unit=
jwt.cert.organisation=
jwt.cert.locality=
jwt.cert.state=
jwt.cert.country=
# Validity of key in days
jwt.cert.key.validity=1825

# The alias name of the public cert in the truststore
jwt.cert.alias=jwtcertalias
#name of the file that will be created which contains the cert's public key. This cert will be imported into the AppServer's truststore
