	requireServer = &quot;true&quot; means that a copy of the server application will be deployed
	with the sample external application, as well as with the main application. This
	has quite obvious memory implications as it means that two copies of the server EJBs
	are deployed using twice the memory. This has been traded off against the fact that
	the application server will optimize calls to these EJBs if they are deployed in the
	same VM therefore giving better performance as the java objects do not have to be
	marshalled and un-marshalled as part of the invocation process.
	If this is to be changed to reduce memory footprint we should be aware that the change
	will have an effect on the performance of the application and, depending on the hardware,
	this might be quite noticeable. It should not be changed without due consideration.
