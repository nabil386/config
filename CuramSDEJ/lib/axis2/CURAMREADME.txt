The Axis2 xmlbeans jar file shipped with Cúram have been modified as follows:

xmlbeans-2.3.0.jar - upgraded to xmlbeans 2.6.0, for few bug fixes in xmlbinding and removal of org.w3.doc.* classes that was incorrectly included in xmlbeans 2.3.0 version, causing conflicts in websphere / runtime issues.
